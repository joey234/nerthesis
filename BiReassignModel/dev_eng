The <ORGANIZATION_1>National Weather Service</ORGANIZATION_1> told us this afternoon it is El Nino causing these huge waves on the <LOCATION_2>California</LOCATION_2> coast , and despite the sand berms , some ocean front homes suffered minor flooding .
In nearly three days , they have only made it as far as the <LOCATION_1>Mediterranean</LOCATION_1> .
You remember <LOCATION_1>Cuba</LOCATION_1> .
Tonight , one of the reasons that going to <LOCATION_1>Cuba</LOCATION_1> was a special experience this time , because it was a chance to spend a little time with <ORGANIZATION_2>ABC</ORGANIZATION_2> 's <PERSON_3>Antonio Mora</PERSON_3> in the very place where he was born .
<PERSON_1>Maria Louisa de la Toriente Sendawal</PERSON_1> my grandfather 's name , and , oh , boy .
<PERSON_1>Antonio</PERSON_1> 's great grandfather , <PERSON_2>Cosme de la Toriente</PERSON_2> , was a much loved politician and diplomat in <LOCATION_3>Cuba</LOCATION_3> .
<PERSON_1>Antonio</PERSON_1> 's father went to the same schools as <PERSON_2>Castro</PERSON_2> throughout the nineteen forties , and initially , <PERSON_3>Antonio</PERSON_3> 's father supported <PERSON_4>Castro</PERSON_4> .
They never returned to <LOCATION_1>Cuba</LOCATION_1> , leaving behind a very comfortable life of large houses , servants and a country farm .
And the stately home of <PERSON_1>John</PERSON_1> is now an apartment building .
And <PERSON_1>Antonio</PERSON_1> also understands that this is now someone else 's place .
Later this evening , twenty twenty , an interview with <PERSON_1>Monica Lewinsky</PERSON_1> 's lawyer .
It is a strategy to put pressure on the independent counsel to make a deal in Southern <LOCATION_1>California</LOCATION_1> .
Here 's <PERSON_1>Elizabeth Vargas</PERSON_1> .
But <PERSON_1>Cohen</PERSON_1> stressed that the strike would not be able to remove <PERSON_2>Saddam Hussein</PERSON_2> from power or eliminate his deadly arsenal .
<ORGANIZATION_1>ABC</ORGANIZATION_1> 's <PERSON_2>John McWethy</PERSON_2> reports .
With more American firepower being considered for the <LOCATION_1>Persian Gulf</LOCATION_1> , <ORGANIZATION_2>Defense</ORGANIZATION_2> Secretary <PERSON_3>Cohen</PERSON_3> today issued toughest criticism of the <ORGANIZATION_4>UN Security Council</ORGANIZATION_4> .
Frankly , I find it incredibly hard to accept the proposition that , in the face of <PERSON_1>Saddam</PERSON_1> 's actions , that members of the <ORGANIZATION_2>Security Council</ORGANIZATION_2> cannot bring themselves to declare that this is a fundamental or material breach of conduct on his part .
In <LOCATION_1>Europe</LOCATION_1> today , Secretary of <ORGANIZATION_2>State for Foreign Affrais</ORGANIZATION_2> <PERSON_3>Albright</PERSON_3> , trying to gather support for tougher measures , was told by the British and French that before they will join the <LOCATION_4>US</LOCATION_4> in using force , they insist the <ORGANIZATION_5>Security Council</ORGANIZATION_5> pass yet another resolution .
British Prime Minister <PERSON_1>Blair</PERSON_1> said if <PERSON_2>Saddam Hussein</PERSON_2> then does not comply The only option to enforce the <ORGANIZATION_3>Security Council</ORGANIZATION_3> 's will is military action .
But even a massive air campaign has sharp limits against a leader like <PERSON_1>Saddam Hussein</PERSON_1> .
<PERSON_1>John McWethy</PERSON_1> , <ORGANIZATION_2>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_2> , the <ORGANIZATION_3>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION_3> .
<ORGANIZATION_1>ABC</ORGANIZATION_1> 's <PERSON_2>Sheila MacVicar</PERSON_2> is also in the Iraqi capital .
We know very little about what is on the table with the Russians except for what <PERSON_1>Posuvalyuk</PERSON_1> himself has said .
You talk about concessions , <PERSON_1>Sheila</PERSON_1> , is there any chance , or what are the chances , in fact that that this will be settled in the coming days ?
We do know there are some reports in <LOCATION_1>Baghdad</LOCATION_1> tonight , and I must emphasize these are unconfirmed reports , that say that in an emergency session of <LOCATION_2>Iraq</LOCATION_2> 's national assembly on Monday morning there will be some kind of proposal voted where the national assembly members ask <LOCATION_3>Iraq</LOCATION_3> 's President , <PERSON_4>Saddam Hussein</PERSON_4> , to open the palace to the inspectors .
In the <LOCATION_1>Middle East</LOCATION_1> , the Palestinians today moved to fulfill a promise to President <PERSON_2>Clinton</PERSON_2> .
The news came as Secretary of <ORGANIZATION_1>State for Foreign Affrais</ORGANIZATION_1> <PERSON_2>Madeleine Albright</PERSON_2> met with Israeli Prime Minister <PERSON_3>Benjamin Netanyahu</PERSON_3> .
There is still no deal with independent counsel <PERSON_1>Kenneth Starr</PERSON_1> that would allow <PERSON_2>Monica Lewinsky</PERSON_2> to testify .
For the President , it was time for a much needed break , a trip to <LOCATION_1>Camp David</LOCATION_1> with family , friends and golf .
The latest <ORGANIZATION_1>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_1> poll shows that <PERSON_2>Clinton</PERSON_2> is not only containing the damage from the <PERSON_3>Lewinsky</PERSON_3> scandal , he is actually gaining some ground .
<PERSON_1>Lucianne Goldberg</PERSON_1> , who encouraged <PERSON_2>Linda Tripp</PERSON_2> to tape her phone calls with <PERSON_3>Monica Lewinsky</PERSON_3> , made vague threats toward <PERSON_4>Lewinsky</PERSON_4> 's lawyers for criticizing <PERSON_5>Tripp</PERSON_5> .
And <PERSON_1>Lewinsky</PERSON_1> 's lawyers suggested she might go home to <LOCATION_2>Los Angeles</LOCATION_2> .
<PERSON_1>Michel McQueen</PERSON_1> , <ORGANIZATION_2>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_2> , <LOCATION_3>Washington</LOCATION_3> .
First Lady <PERSON_1>Hillary Clinton</PERSON_1> is in <LOCATION_2>Switzerland</LOCATION_2> today , and she 's carrying a message , that the crisis in the <ORGANIZATION_3>White House</ORGANIZATION_3> is nothing the rest of the world needs to worry about .

The annual <ORGANIZATION_1>Conservative Political Action Committee</ORGANIZATION_1> , or <ORGANIZATION_2>C PAC</ORGANIZATION_2> conference , is where presidential candidates , past and possibly future , test pre-election waters .
I believe he had some kind of relationship with <PERSON_1>Monica Lewinsky</PERSON_1> , and I don 't think he 's telling us the truth about it .
<PERSON_1>Karla Davis</PERSON_1> , <ORGANIZATION_2>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_2> , <LOCATION_3>Washington</LOCATION_3> .
