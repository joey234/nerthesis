God forbid if <PERSON_1>Terry Nichols</PERSON_1> ever walked the streets again .
I think that the government didn 't do a good job of proving that <PERSON_1>Terry Nichols</PERSON_1> was greatly involved in all of this .
<PERSON_1>Peter</PERSON_1> and <PERSON_2>Bob</PERSON_2> , thanks .
<ORGANIZATION_1>ABC</ORGANIZATION_1> 's <PERSON_2>Dean Reynolds</PERSON_2> is in <LOCATION_3>Oklahoma City</LOCATION_3> .

<PERSON_1>Dean Reynolds</PERSON_1> in <LOCATION_2>Oklahoma City</LOCATION_2> , now we 're going to go back to <LOCATION_3>Denver</LOCATION_3> because our legal analyst <PERSON_4>Jeffrey Toobin</PERSON_4> has been there throughout the trial .

<PERSON_1>John Donvan</PERSON_1> , <ORGANIZATION_2>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_2> , at the <ORGANIZATION_3>White House</ORGANIZATION_3> .
Despite <LOCATION_1>Iran</LOCATION_1> 's recent charm offensive , American officials are wary .
<LOCATION_1>US</LOCATION_1> intelligence sources tell <ORGANIZATION_2>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_2> that Iranian surveillance of American diplomatic and military facilities has , in fact , increased , especially in the <LOCATION_3>Middle East</LOCATION_3> .
In addition , the <ORGANIZATION_1>CIA</ORGANIZATION_1> estimates <LOCATION_2>Iran</LOCATION_2> still provides more than a one hundred million dollar a year to radical Islamic groups such as <ORGANIZATION_3>Hezbollah</ORGANIZATION_3> and <ORGANIZATION_4>Hamas</ORGANIZATION_4> that regularly strike <LOCATION_5>Israel</LOCATION_5> .
But analysts do not believe that <LOCATION_1>Iran</LOCATION_1> 's new president is in charge of either military or terrorist activities .
He has many rivals who will feel threatened by any opening to the <LOCATION_1>US</LOCATION_1> , <PERSON_2>John McWethy</PERSON_2> , <ORGANIZATION_3>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_3> , the <ORGANIZATION_4>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION_4> .

You know no ethical or professional infertility lab would be making crazy statements like were made by <PERSON_1>Seed</PERSON_1> in <LOCATION_2>Chicago</LOCATION_2> .
<PERSON_1>Seed</PERSON_1> predicted his success would remove all opposition .
That 's why <LOCATION_1>California</LOCATION_1> has already banned human cloning .
Today , Secretary of <ORGANIZATION_1>Health and Human Services</ORGANIZATION_1> <PERSON_2>Donna Shalala</PERSON_2> said the <ORGANIZATION_3>Food and Drug Administration</ORGANIZATION_3> could stop <PERSON_4>Seed</PERSON_4> 's experiments , but <PERSON_5>Seed</PERSON_5> said he is already making plans to get around any regulation .

From <ORGANIZATION_1>ABC</ORGANIZATION_1> , this is World News Tonight with <PERSON_2>Peter Jennings</PERSON_2> .
Today , <PERSON_1>Kaczynski</PERSON_1> actually had his lawyers argue to the judge that he should be allowed to defend himself , because his lawyers insist on having a jury hear evidence that suggests <PERSON_2>Kaczynski</PERSON_2> is mentally ill , and he doesn 't want to make any such concession .
It was after <PERSON_1>Kaczynski</PERSON_1> got to court this morning that authorities discovered the apparent suicide .
When one of his attorneys , <PERSON_1>Judy Clarke</PERSON_1> , announced he wanted to represent himself , that resulted in a lengthy discussion about who 's in charge , <PERSON_2>Kaczynski</PERSON_2> or his lawyers , and about whether he is legally competent to be his own attorney .
<PERSON_1>Ken Kashiwahara</PERSON_1> , <ORGANIZATION_2>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_2> , <LOCATION_3>Sacramento</LOCATION_3> .

But elsewhere , including in <LOCATION_1>New York City</LOCATION_1> 's <LOCATION_2>Central Park</LOCATION_2> , you had to make believe it was winter .
The warm weather mass formed in the <LOCATION_1>Pacific</LOCATION_1> is changing weather patterns in places all around the world .
<LOCATION_1>Avery County</LOCATION_1> , <LOCATION_2>North Carolina</LOCATION_2> , too much rain , up to thirteen inches of it in parts of <LOCATION_3>North Carolina</LOCATION_3> .

<PERSON_1>Morton Dean</PERSON_1> , <ORGANIZATION_2>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_2> , <LOCATION_3>New York</LOCATION_3> .
<PERSON_1>Aaron Brown</PERSON_1> , <ORGANIZATION_2>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_2> , <LOCATION_3>New York</LOCATION_3> .
On the other hand , it 's turning out to be another very bad financial week for <LOCATION_1>Asia</LOCATION_1> and financial assistance from the <ORGANIZATION_2>World Bank</ORGANIZATION_2> and the <ORGANIZATION_3>International Monetary Fund</ORGANIZATION_3> are not helping .
More problems in <LOCATION_1>Hong Kong</LOCATION_1> for a place , for an economy , that many experts thought was once invincible .
So when <PERSON_1>Wong Kwan</PERSON_1> spent seventy million dollars for this house , he thought it was a great deal .

We found this particularly interesting because the <ORGANIZATION_1>Professional Golfers Association</ORGANIZATION_1> tour says he shouldn 't be playing at all .
Here is <ORGANIZATION_1>ABC</ORGANIZATION_1> 's <PERSON_2>Mike Von Fremd</PERSON_2> .
I want that to be the determinant whether I can make the <ORGANIZATION_1>PGA</ORGANIZATION_1> tour , whether I can hit the shots , not whether I can walk well enough .
We have the highest regard for <PERSON_1>Casey Martin</PERSON_1> , but frankly we don 't think this case is about <PERSON_2>Casey Martin</PERSON_2> .
There is nothing in the rules published by the <ORGANIZATION_1>United States Golf Association</ORGANIZATION_1> that requires walking the course .
<PERSON_1>Mike Von Fremd</PERSON_1> , <ORGANIZATION_2>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_2> , <LOCATION_3>Lakeland</LOCATION_3> , <LOCATION_4>Florida</LOCATION_4> .

<PERSON_1>Bill</PERSON_1> and <PERSON_2>Emily</PERSON_2> went off to this restaurant for brunch , and <PERSON_3>Emily</PERSON_3> , who is a puzzle fanatic , was doing her usual thing .
<PERSON_1>Bill G</PERSON_1> could be <PERSON_2>Bill Gates</PERSON_2> .
The <ORGANIZATION_1>Times</ORGANIZATION_1> had actually given <PERSON_2>Bill</PERSON_2> the answers to help <PERSON_3>Emily</PERSON_3> along if she got stuck .
The <ORGANIZATION_1>Times</ORGANIZATION_1> , and <PERSON_2>Bill</PERSON_2> , apparently , were fairly sure of <PERSON_3>Emily</PERSON_3> 's answer .
And <PERSON_1>Sonny Bono</PERSON_1> remembered by those who loved him .
In eastern <LOCATION_1>Canada</LOCATION_1> and the very northeastern <LOCATION_2>United States</LOCATION_2> , some people have been freezing in the dark for much of the week .
But it 's so bad in eastern <LOCATION_1>Canada</LOCATION_1> tonight , in <LOCATION_2>Quebec</LOCATION_2> and <LOCATION_3>Montreal</LOCATION_3> , for example , that , at the very last moment , the feed bringing our report out of <LOCATION_4>Montreal</LOCATION_4> didn 't work as a result of the weather , so we 're going to shift gears a little and start with <ORGANIZATION_5>ABC</ORGANIZATION_5> 's <PERSON_6>Mort Dean</PERSON_6> .
<LOCATION_1>Bangor</LOCATION_1> , <LOCATION_2>Maine</LOCATION_2> , a similar scene and a similar story .

The latest attempt by <PERSON_1>Dick Rutan</PERSON_1> and <PERSON_2>Dave Melton</PERSON_2> began only this morning , and it didn 't last very long .
Not the way veteran pilot <PERSON_1>Dick Rutan</PERSON_1> thought his highly anticipated million dollar balloon ride around the world would end .
The unique craft that was supposed to allow <PERSON_1>Rutan</PERSON_1> to make it around the world was designed as a balloon within a balloon with a helium center .
Once the sun sets and temperatures drop , <PERSON_1>Rutan</PERSON_1> hopes the balloon will fall to <LOCATION_2>Earth</LOCATION_2> by itself .

The Indonesian president , <PERSON_1>Suharto</PERSON_1> , has refused to implement reforms that the <ORGANIZATION_2>IMF</ORGANIZATION_2> has demanded as a condition of its bailout .
More on the crisis from <ORGANIZATION_1>ABC</ORGANIZATION_1> 's <PERSON_2>David Ensor</PERSON_2> .
Another problem , in <LOCATION_1>Indonesia</LOCATION_1> many big businesses are believed to be corrupt , closely tied to President <PERSON_2>Suharto</PERSON_2> 's family , and unwilling to change their ways .

<ORGANIZATION_1>ABC</ORGANIZATION_1> 's <PERSON_2>Brian Rooney</PERSON_2> .
<PERSON_1>Tony Orlando</PERSON_1> , the singer , and a silver haired <PERSON_2>Jerry Vale</PERSON_2> .
But you still can 't mention the name <PERSON_1>Sonny</PERSON_1> without <PERSON_2>Cher</PERSON_2> , his former wife and partner .
As a matter of fact , one of the first things that he ever told me was that he was a descendant of <PERSON_1>Napoleon</PERSON_1> .
That person will always be <PERSON_1>Son</PERSON_1> for me .
<PERSON_1>Brian Rooney</PERSON_1> , <ORGANIZATION_2>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_2> , <LOCATION_3>Palm Springs</LOCATION_3> .
As some of you may have heard , <ORGANIZATION_1>ABC</ORGANIZATION_1> 's <PERSON_2>Sam Donaldson</PERSON_2> returns to covering the <ORGANIZATION_3>White House</ORGANIZATION_3> for us on Monday , about which we are very pleased .
Meet Congressman <PERSON_1>Tom Coburn</PERSON_1> of <LOCATION_2>Muskogee</LOCATION_2> , <LOCATION_3>Oklahoma</LOCATION_3> .
<PERSON_1>Coburn</PERSON_1> says he spends four days a week back home , treating patients young and old in his office and in this hospital and also meeting some of his constituents , on this day , students at a local elementary school .
So now , the <ORGANIZATION_1>House Ethics Committee</ORGANIZATION_1> is trying to decide whether even billing his patients for expenses raises the question that the parents of babies <PERSON_2>Coburn</PERSON_2> delivered could have chosen him , hoping to sway his vote .
For the moment , the two <PERSON_1>Coburns</PERSON_1> are being allowed to coexist , but the <ORGANIZATION_2>Ethics Committee</ORGANIZATION_2> is still deliberating .
If the <ORGANIZATION_1>Ethics Committee</ORGANIZATION_1> says , <PERSON_2>Coburn</PERSON_2> , you can either be Congressman <PERSON_3>Coburn</PERSON_3> or <PERSON_4>Coburn</PERSON_4> , which will you if I lose that battle , I 'm going to be a doctor .
And sometimes , as in the case of <PERSON_1>Tom Coburn</PERSON_1> , that would seem to be true , <PERSON_2>Peter</PERSON_2> .
In the run up to the winter Olympics , <PERSON_1>Michelle Kwan</PERSON_1> skated to near perfection last night in the first phase of the <LOCATION_2>US</LOCATION_2> National Championships .
Her number one competitor , <PERSON_1>Tara Lipinski</PERSON_1> , who is currently the <LOCATION_2>US</LOCATION_2> champion , fell , as you can see , during last night 's competition .
And we chose <PERSON_1>Isaac Stern</PERSON_1> because he brought music to life .
When we looked at the leaders who were having an impact in the <LOCATION_1>Middle East</LOCATION_1> , the phones never stopped ringing .
One time , we chose a whole town , <LOCATION_1>West Twin Rivers</LOCATION_1> , <LOCATION_2>Maryland</LOCATION_2> , which took in the victims of a train crash .
<PERSON_1>George Foreman</PERSON_1> , champion again at forty-five .
And there was <PERSON_1>Mollie Beattie</PERSON_1> , who fought for wildlife in the national parks and then , very young , lost in a battle with cancer .

The <ORGANIZATION_1>National Weather Service</ORGANIZATION_1> does not blame El Nino for this storm , instead they believe a warm stream of air traveling from the <LOCATION_2>Gulf of Mexico</LOCATION_2> collided with an arctic front from <LOCATION_3>Canada</LOCATION_3> .
<PERSON_1>Burt Gendron</PERSON_1> has already lost ninety percent of his trees , and he 's still not done cutting .

The thaw finally began today , but as <ORGANIZATION_1>ABC</ORGANIZATION_1> 's <PERSON_2>Bill Redeker</PERSON_2> reports from <LOCATION_3>Montreal</LOCATION_3> , that thaw is bringing little relief .
Even tomorrow night 's <ORGANIZATION_1>Rolling Stones</ORGANIZATION_1> concert has been canceled because the ice storm tore a hole in the roof of the <LOCATION_2>Montreal</LOCATION_2> 's billion dollar Olympic stadium .
<PERSON_1>Bill Redeker</PERSON_1> , <ORGANIZATION_2>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_2> , <LOCATION_3>Montreal</LOCATION_3> .

Former <LOCATION_1>US</LOCATION_1> Senator <PERSON_2>George Mitchell</PERSON_2> is representing <LOCATION_3>US</LOCATION_3> interests in the talks , but it is another American center , senator rather , who was the focus of attention in <LOCATION_4>Northern Ireland</LOCATION_4> today .

<ORGANIZATION_2>ABC</ORGANIZATION_2> 's legal affairs correspondent <PERSON_3>Terry Moran</PERSON_3> is in <LOCATION_4>Sacramento</LOCATION_4> tonight .
<PERSON_1>Theodore Kaczynski</PERSON_1> will be evaluated by <PERSON_2>Sally Johnson</PERSON_2> , a federal prison psychiatrist who examined would be presidential assassin <PERSON_3>John Hinckley</PERSON_3> and disgraced televangelist <PERSON_4>Jim Baker</PERSON_4> before their trials .
<PERSON_1>Kaczynski</PERSON_1> would rather defend himself than let his attorneys depict him as mentally ill .
The last notorious defendant who represented himself was <PERSON_1>Colin Ferguson</PERSON_1> , who killed nine people on a <LOCATION_2>New York</LOCATION_2> commuter train .
So if he 's found competent , the judge must decide what should take precedence , <PERSON_1>Ted Kaczynski</PERSON_1> 's right to defend himself or his life .
<PERSON_1>Terry Moran</PERSON_1> , <ORGANIZATION_2>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_2> , <LOCATION_3>Sacramento</LOCATION_3> .

<PERSON_1>Jack Smith</PERSON_1> , <ORGANIZATION_2>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_2> , <LOCATION_3>Las Vegas</LOCATION_3> .

And tonight , the main event here on <ORGANIZATION_1>ABC</ORGANIZATION_1> , <PERSON_2>Michelle Kwan</PERSON_2> and <PERSON_3>Tara Lipinski</PERSON_3> continue their extraordinary rivalry .
But it 's not academics that has people excited about <ORGANIZATION_1>Princeton</ORGANIZATION_1> this year .
Teams like <LOCATION_1>Texas</LOCATION_1> , <ORGANIZATION_2>North Carolina State</ORGANIZATION_2> and <ORGANIZATION_3>Wake Forest</ORGANIZATION_3> .
<ORGANIZATION_1>Princeton</ORGANIZATION_1> 's coach is flattered , but does not want all the attention going to his players 's heads .
Since the sixties , when former <ORGANIZATION_1>NBA</ORGANIZATION_1> great <PERSON_2>Bill Bradley</PERSON_2> was a <ORGANIZATION_3>Princeton Tiger</ORGANIZATION_3> .
<ORGANIZATION_1>Princeton</ORGANIZATION_1> has always placed a greater emphasis on the scholar in scholar athlete .

I 'm <PERSON_1>Aaron Brown</PERSON_1> .
Yes , the news room here at <ORGANIZATION_1>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_1> in <LOCATION_2>New York</LOCATION_2> has been modernized is as good a word as any .
The <LOCATION_1>United States</LOCATION_1> and <LOCATION_2>Iraq</LOCATION_2> , <LOCATION_3>Iraq</LOCATION_3> and the <ORGANIZATION_4>United Nations</ORGANIZATION_4> have got themselves into yet another bind .
And so , first , we go to <ORGANIZATION_1>ABC</ORGANIZATION_1> 's <PERSON_2>Ron Claiborne</PERSON_2> , who 's in <LOCATION_3>Baghdad</LOCATION_3> .
It 's not just the composition of <PERSON_1>Ritter</PERSON_1> 's inspection team the Iraqis object to , but <PERSON_2>Ritter</PERSON_2> himself .
<PERSON_1>Ron Claiborne</PERSON_1> , <ORGANIZATION_2>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_2> , <LOCATION_3>Baghdad</LOCATION_3> .
Nice to have you back on the beat again , <PERSON_1>Sam Donaldson</PERSON_1> .
<PERSON_1>Saddam</PERSON_1> must comply or else , without exactly specifying what that or else might be .
If <PERSON_1>Saddam Hussein</PERSON_1> does this , it is a clear and serious violation of the <ORGANIZATION_2>United Nations Security Council</ORGANIZATION_2> resolution .

Well , he 's getting away with , you know , willful violations and harassment of <ORGANIZATION_1>UN</ORGANIZATION_1> objectives there , and the <ORGANIZATION_2>UN</ORGANIZATION_2> has responded to that .
The administration insists this is a <ORGANIZATION_1>UN</ORGANIZATION_1> problem , but if <PERSON_2>Saddam</PERSON_2> gets away with American inspectors , <ORGANIZATION_3>White House</ORGANIZATION_3> officials here understand it will be seen as a victory over the <LOCATION_4>US</LOCATION_4> and <PERSON_5>Bill Clinton</PERSON_5> , not over <ORGANIZATION_6>UN</ORGANIZATION_6> Secretary General <PERSON_7>Kofi Annan</PERSON_7> .
Does the <ORGANIZATION_1>White House</ORGANIZATION_1> think the situation is better , worse or about the same ?

<ORGANIZATION_1>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_1> has learned that the <ORGANIZATION_2>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION_2> is deep into an investigation of the President 's secretary of the labor , <PERSON_3>Alexis Herman</PERSON_3> .
<ORGANIZATION_1>ABC</ORGANIZATION_1> 's chief investigative reporter , <PERSON_2>Brian Ross</PERSON_2> , is on the story .
As a top assistant to President <PERSON_1>Clinton</PERSON_1> , <PERSON_2>Alexis Herman</PERSON_2> had power and connections inside the <ORGANIZATION_3>White House</ORGANIZATION_3> .
To <PERSON_1>Alexis Herman</PERSON_1> , the <ORGANIZATION_2>United Nations</ORGANIZATION_2> is very suspicious .
The <ORGANIZATION_1>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION_1> investigation of <PERSON_2>Herman</PERSON_2> began last October with <PERSON_3>Laurent Yene</PERSON_3> , a businessman from <LOCATION_4>Africa</LOCATION_4> whose allegations , officials say , were found credible enough to extend the initial thirty day review to a second stage , ninety day review , a process that could lead to the appointment of an independent counsel .
<PERSON_1>Yene</PERSON_1> has told <ORGANIZATION_2>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION_2> lawyers and <ORGANIZATION_3>FBI</ORGANIZATION_3> agents that he and <PERSON_4>Herman</PERSON_4> and one of <PERSON_5>Herman</PERSON_5> 's close friends began a secret arrangement in nineteen ninety-four to sell <PERSON_6>Herman</PERSON_6> 's <ORGANIZATION_7>White House</ORGANIZATION_7> influence to clients needing help from the government , allegedly giving <PERSON_8>Herman</PERSON_8> ten percent of any consulting fees .
The documents do not contain <PERSON_1>Herman</PERSON_1> 's name , but <PERSON_2>Yene</PERSON_2> says they lay out a complex financial scheme to funnel money to <PERSON_3>Herman</PERSON_3> for helping one client obtain an <ORGANIZATION_4>FCC</ORGANIZATION_4> license for a satellite telephone system .
Even though she worked at the <ORGANIZATION_1>White House</ORGANIZATION_1> ?
Secretary <PERSON_1>Herman</PERSON_1> 's friend and the client seeking the <ORGANIZATION_2>FCC</ORGANIZATION_2> license called <PERSON_3>Yene</PERSON_3> a liar seeking revenge because of a falling out over business and personal matters .
Okay , <PERSON_1>Brian Ross</PERSON_1> , thanks very much .
<ORGANIZATION_1>ABC</ORGANIZATION_1> 's <PERSON_2>Sam Donaldson</PERSON_2> is there .
But the difference is that <PERSON_1>Herman</PERSON_1> 's accuser did not at the time claim to be giving cash to her in return for favors for the business , as he has now claimed to <PERSON_2>Brian Ross</PERSON_2> .
<PERSON_1>Clinton</PERSON_1> was deposed today ?
There was only nine minutes , ten minutes of questions , and <PERSON_1>Clinton</PERSON_1> told him under oath , and the person that questioned her , that she had no knowledge whatsoever of how those files were obtained .
It 's not clear yet how far the judge is going to allow her attorneys to delve into <PERSON_1>Clinton</PERSON_1> 's past .

In cities across <LOCATION_1>Cuba</LOCATION_1> , workers are preparing for the Pope 's visit , and already that visit is altering some realities .
He made a point , though , of condemning the <LOCATION_1>US</LOCATION_1> embargo against <LOCATION_2>Cuba</LOCATION_2> , something the Pope is certain to do in his sermons next week .
But Cuban officials are quick to insist that they have no fear that the Pope will undermine <PERSON_1>Castro</PERSON_1> 's power .

From <ORGANIZATION_1>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_1> world headquarters in <LOCATION_2>New York</LOCATION_2> , Monday , January 19 , this is World News Tonight with <PERSON_3>Peter Jennings</PERSON_3> Good evening .
They have had a terrible weekend trying to figure out why such a sudden outburst of violence engulfed their students on a trip to <LOCATION_1>Central America</LOCATION_1> .
<PERSON_1>David Ensor</PERSON_1> reports there are now difficult questions for the college and for <LOCATION_2>Washington</LOCATION_2> .
Recent incidents , says the <ORGANIZATION_1>State Department</ORGANIZATION_1> , which include shootings , kidnappings , rapes and violent assaults , for the most part , have occurred during daylight hours and , in many cases , have affected entire groups of American tourists .

The chief <ORGANIZATION_1>UN</ORGANIZATION_1> weapons inspector , who has been talking with senior Iraqi officials , appeared to soften one of his long standing positions , that <LOCATION_2>Iraq</LOCATION_2> have no say in how many Americans work on the inspection teams .
As he arrived in <LOCATION_1>Baghdad</LOCATION_1> , <PERSON_2>Butler</PERSON_2> sent a strong signal that he may now be willing to yield to <LOCATION_3>Iraq</LOCATION_3> 's demand for more non American inspectors .
But <PERSON_1>Butler</PERSON_1> again demanded full access to <PERSON_2>Saddam Hussein</PERSON_2> 's presidential palaces , which <LOCATION_3>Iraq</LOCATION_3> has declared off limits .
And in a demonstration timed to coincide with <PERSON_1>Butler</PERSON_1> 's visit , Iraqi women marched alongside a caravan of taxis today bearing the coffins of infants they say died because of the sanctions .

In <LOCATION_1>London</LOCATION_1> today , the men who run the political wing of the <ORGANIZATION_2>Irish Republican Army</ORGANIZATION_2> were at the Prime Minister 's residence for another unsatisfactory negotiating session about how to share power in <LOCATION_3>Northern Ireland</LOCATION_3> .
The accusations are made in a book by the former <LOCATION_1>US</LOCATION_1> ambassador to <LOCATION_2>Britain</LOCATION_2> , <PERSON_3>Raymond Seitz</PERSON_3> , and one of those he takes to task is the current <LOCATION_4>US</LOCATION_4> ambassador to <LOCATION_5>Ireland</LOCATION_5> , <PERSON_6>Jean Kennedy Smith</PERSON_6> , the late President <PERSON_7>Kennedy</PERSON_7> 's sister .
Former Ambassador <PERSON_1>Seitz</PERSON_1> claimed the last British government under Prime Minister <PERSON_2>John Major</PERSON_2> was convinced that the <PERSON_3>Clinton</PERSON_3> administration was leaking British secrets to the <ORGANIZATION_4>IRA</ORGANIZATION_4> .
She was an ardent <ORGANIZATION_1>IRA</ORGANIZATION_1> apologist .
Ambassador <PERSON_1>Seitz</PERSON_1> did not directly accused <PERSON_2>Kennedy Smith</PERSON_2> of passing on British secrets to the <ORGANIZATION_3>IRA</ORGANIZATION_3> , but a former British minister for <LOCATION_4>Northern Ireland</LOCATION_4> said today that <LOCATION_5>London</LOCATION_5> did withhold intelligence from the <LOCATION_6>US</LOCATION_6> , fearing that leaks from her might endanger the lives of British soldiers .
Ambassador <PERSON_1>Seitz</PERSON_1> had often argued against negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION_2>IRA</ORGANIZATION_2> , such as those held today at <LOCATION_3>Number ten Downing Street</LOCATION_3> .

Many of those residents rejected the school board 's proposal to name the new school for <PERSON_1>Martin Luther King , Junior</PERSON_1> , the majority of people there are going to be white or with more money , and that 's not what <PERSON_2>Martin Luther King</PERSON_2> worked for at all .
Some people think that <PERSON_1>Martin Luther King , Junior</PERSON_1> was a hero for African Americans and not for all Americans , and they think that anything that bears his name is somehow stigmatized apparently .
From <LOCATION_1>Chicago</LOCATION_1> to <LOCATION_2>New Jersey</LOCATION_2> to <LOCATION_3>Los Angeles</LOCATION_3> and <LOCATION_4>Miami</LOCATION_4> , the streets that bear his name are boulevards of broken dreams .
I live in one of the roughest neighborhoods there is , and <LOCATION_1>Martin Luther King street</LOCATION_1> is right by where I live , so I just feel like it tells me to do the best that I can with what I have .

In court , the question turned on whether <PERSON_1>Kaczynski</PERSON_1> will be allowed to represent himself , as he has requested .
The judge could order the attorneys to do what <PERSON_1>Kaczynski</PERSON_1> wants , but today his lawyers said they would oppose that , or he could order <PERSON_2>Kaczynski</PERSON_2> to agree to a mental illness defense .

I want to reaffirm to the people of <LOCATION_1>Israel</LOCATION_1> the the strong support of the <LOCATION_2>United States</LOCATION_2> for <LOCATION_3>Israel</LOCATION_3> and the strong support of the <LOCATION_4>United States</LOCATION_4> for the security of <LOCATION_5>Israel</LOCATION_5> .
And it doesn 't help the atmosphere when , upon arriving in <LOCATION_1>Washington</LOCATION_1> last night , <PERSON_2>Netanyahu</PERSON_2> almost immediately addressed a gathering of conservatives that included such fierce <PERSON_3>Clinton</PERSON_3> critics .
Today , at the <ORGANIZATION_1>White House</ORGANIZATION_1> , President <PERSON_2>Clinton</PERSON_2> pointedly couldn 't even take time to have lunch with <PERSON_3>Netanyahu</PERSON_3> .
Then the President went off to play golf , and the Secretary of <ORGANIZATION_1>State</ORGANIZATION_1> conferred with <PERSON_2>Netanyahu</PERSON_2> .
<PERSON_1>Sam Donaldson</PERSON_1> , <ORGANIZATION_2>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_2> , the <ORGANIZATION_3>White House</ORGANIZATION_3> .
And the <ORGANIZATION_1>Holocaust Memorial Museum</ORGANIZATION_1> in <LOCATION_2>Washington</LOCATION_2> has reversed itself and invited <PERSON_3>Arafat</PERSON_3> to receive a special tour .
The <ORGANIZATION_1>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION_1> said today it will re-examine the question are the remains inside the Tomb of the Unknown from the <LOCATION_2>Vietnam</LOCATION_2> War , in fact , known ?
And later , <PERSON_1>Peter Jennings</PERSON_1> from <LOCATION_2>Havana</LOCATION_2> on the Pope , <PERSON_3>Fidel Castro</PERSON_3> and why both men are taking what some say is a big gamble .
The case centers around <PERSON_1>Oprah</PERSON_1> 's power as a television personality and some claims she made on her program about American beef and Mad Cow disease .
<ORGANIZATION_1>ABC</ORGANIZATION_1> 's <PERSON_2>Mike von Fremd</PERSON_2> is in <LOCATION_3>Amarillo</LOCATION_3> .
In the days after <PERSON_1>Oprah</PERSON_1> 's show , the average price for a head of cattle fell nearly ten percent .

In the <LOCATION_1>United Arab Emirates</LOCATION_1> today , the first pictures of a baby cama .
And now , we go back to <PERSON_1>Peter Jennings</PERSON_1> in <LOCATION_2>Cuba</LOCATION_2> .
Each of them has something to say about the <LOCATION_1>United States</LOCATION_1> as well .
<PERSON_1>John Paul</PERSON_1> 's advancing Parkinson 's disease may have slowed his step , but not , apparently , his will to push for political change .
He opposes the <LOCATION_1>US</LOCATION_1> embargo of <LOCATION_2>Cuba</LOCATION_2> , arguing it only hurts ordinary Cubans .
And the Pope from <LOCATION_1>Poland</LOCATION_1> is a champion of small countries remaining completely independent from large powerful neighbors , as <PERSON_2>Castro</PERSON_2> 's <LOCATION_3>Cuba</LOCATION_3> has from the <LOCATION_4>US</LOCATION_4> .
But this Pope is also a champion of human rights , and he 's expected to say clearly in <LOCATION_1>Cuba</LOCATION_1> that <PERSON_2>Castro</PERSON_2> must begin to give Cubans more freedoms .
<PERSON_1>Fidel Castro</PERSON_1> will hear such calls for freedom in person this week from the world 's most famous living force for nonviolent change .
<PERSON_1>Bill Blakemore</PERSON_1> , <ORGANIZATION_2>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_2> , <LOCATION_3>Vatican City</LOCATION_3> .
<PERSON_1>Fidel Castro</PERSON_1> invited <PERSON_2>John Paul</PERSON_2> to come for a reason .
It will give the rest of the world a view that <LOCATION_1>Cuba</LOCATION_1> is like any other nation , something the <LOCATION_2>US</LOCATION_2> has , of course , tried to persuade the world that it is not .
The main positive for <PERSON_1>Castro</PERSON_1> to invite the Pope is international , to be able to say to the rest of the world , this government is not as closed , as intolerant , as totalitarian as some make it out to be .
At the end of the broadcast this evening , one more trip around <LOCATION_1>Havana</LOCATION_1> to see what it 's been like since the last time .
Computer giants <ORGANIZATION_1>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION_1> , <ORGANIZATION_2>Intel</ORGANIZATION_2> and <ORGANIZATION_3>Compaq</ORGANIZATION_3> have reportedly agreed to join with local telephone companies around the country in support of a new technology that could dramatically speed up access to the internet .
<PERSON_1>Gina Smith</PERSON_1> , <ORGANIZATION_2>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_2> , <LOCATION_3>New York</LOCATION_3> .
A new <ORGANIZATION_1>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_1> poll shows that forty-six per cent see the government in a positive light .
She has stayed in top physical shape since she was <PERSON_1>Christa McAuliffe</PERSON_1> 's backup on the Challenger mission .
Thank you , <PERSON_1>Diane</PERSON_1> .
First of all , despite the hardship , Cubans are famous for the <ORGANIZATION_1>White House</ORGANIZATION_1> .
From <ORGANIZATION_1>ABC</ORGANIZATION_1> , this is World News Tonight with <PERSON_2>Peter Jennings</PERSON_2> .
The other very big story of the day is in <LOCATION_1>Washington</LOCATION_1> , where the <PERSON_2>Clinton</PERSON_2> administration has already been badly shaken up by the possibility that President <PERSON_3>Clinton</PERSON_3> and one of his advisors , <PERSON_4>Vernon Jordan</PERSON_4> , obstructed justice by encouraging a young woman to commit perjury about an affair she is alleged to have had with the President .
We 'll talk to our legal analyst <PERSON_1>Jeffrey Toobin</PERSON_1> .
But first , we go to <ORGANIZATION_1>ABC</ORGANIZATION_1> 's <PERSON_2>Sam Donaldson</PERSON_2> , where the bombshell fell at the <ORGANIZATION_3>White House</ORGANIZATION_3> .
<PERSON_1>Sam</PERSON_1> and <PERSON_2>Peter</PERSON_2> , it 's been a confusing day here at the <ORGANIZATION_3>White House</ORGANIZATION_3> , as President <PERSON_4>Clinton</PERSON_4> and his aides have sought to satisfy a stunned public that <PERSON_5>Clinton</PERSON_5> is totally innocent of these dangerous charges .
Had there been a sexual relationship , proper or improper , with <PERSON_1>Monica Lewinsky</PERSON_1> in the past when she was a <ORGANIZATION_2>White House</ORGANIZATION_2> intern ?
Aides said the President would clear up these ambiguities in a subsequent interview at the <ORGANIZATION_1>White House</ORGANIZATION_1> with <ORGANIZATION_2>National Public Radio</ORGANIZATION_2> interviewers <PERSON_3>Robert Siegel</PERSON_3> and <PERSON_4>Mara Liasson</PERSON_4> .
<ORGANIZATION_1>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_1> has learned from sources that the woman , after she left the <ORGANIZATION_2>White House</ORGANIZATION_2> employment , was cleared in often , sometimes late at night .
Late today , the independent counsel <PERSON_1>Kenneth Starr</PERSON_1> sent over a wide ranging subpoena for all of the records that have to do with <PERSON_2>Lewinsky</PERSON_2> 's visits or time at the <ORGANIZATION_3>White House</ORGANIZATION_3> .
We first learned about this story from <ORGANIZATION_1>ABC</ORGANIZATION_1> 's <PERSON_2>Jackie Judd</PERSON_2> .
When <PERSON_1>Monica Lewinsky</PERSON_1> left the <ORGANIZATION_2>White House</ORGANIZATION_2> to work at the <ORGANIZATION_3>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION_3> , she became friends with this woman , <PERSON_4>Linda Tripp</PERSON_4> , and it is <PERSON_5>Tripp</PERSON_5> who , months later , brought <PERSON_6>Lewinsky</PERSON_6> to the attention of the independent counsel , <PERSON_7>Ken Starr</PERSON_7> .
<ORGANIZATION_1>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_1> has learned that last summer <PERSON_2>Tripp</PERSON_2> began recording her phone conversations with <PERSON_3>Lewinsky</PERSON_3> in which the young woman allegedly spoke about her affair with <PERSON_4>Clinton</PERSON_4> and his efforts to convince her to lie to cover it up .
She had earlier worked at the <ORGANIZATION_1>White House</ORGANIZATION_1> , and one source says she was angry when <PERSON_2>Clinton</PERSON_2> 's attorney <PERSON_3>Robert Bennett</PERSON_3> called her a liar for claiming the President had made a pass at another <ORGANIZATION_4>White House</ORGANIZATION_4> aide .
Why would <PERSON_1>Tripp</PERSON_1> go to <PERSON_2>Starr</PERSON_2> ?
Because <PERSON_1>Tripp</PERSON_1> knew independent counsel <PERSON_2>Starr</PERSON_2> and didn 't trust the <ORGANIZATION_3>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION_3> to protect her , <PERSON_4>Tripp</PERSON_4> went to <PERSON_5>Starr</PERSON_5> with tapes of more than ten calls with <PERSON_6>Lewinsky</PERSON_6> .
<ORGANIZATION_1>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_1> also has learned that <PERSON_2>Starr</PERSON_2> 's office and the <ORGANIZATION_3>FBI</ORGANIZATION_3> wired <PERSON_4>Tripp</PERSON_4> to record a conversation with <PERSON_5>Lewinsky</PERSON_5> and gave her equipment to tape more calls so that investigators could hear for themselves what had been in the earlier tapes .
<PERSON_1>Lewinsky</PERSON_1> allegedly claims in the tapes that <PERSON_2>Clinton</PERSON_2> told her to deny their relationship to <PERSON_3>Jones</PERSON_3> ' lawyers and to see <PERSON_4>Clinton</PERSON_4> confidante <PERSON_5>Vernon Jordan</PERSON_5> .
Sources tell <ORGANIZATION_1>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_1> that <PERSON_2>Jordan</PERSON_2> also helped <PERSON_3>Lewinsky</PERSON_3> find a lawyer , who filed a sworn affidavit in which she did deny a sexual relationship with the President .
Sources say as of now , <PERSON_1>Peter</PERSON_1> , she plans on taking the Fifth .
<PERSON_1>Jackie Judd</PERSON_1> in <LOCATION_2>Washington</LOCATION_2> , who , as I said , first brought this story to light .
<PERSON_1>Jeffrey</PERSON_1> , on what basis does <PERSON_2>Kenneth Starr</PERSON_2> get involved in this in the first place ?
But his jurisdiction , over the four years he 's been in office , has been expanded several times to include the <ORGANIZATION_1>Travel Office</ORGANIZATION_1> allegations , the <ORGANIZATION_2>FBI</ORGANIZATION_2> files issue <PERSON_3>Vince Foster</PERSON_3> 's suicide .
It came very quickly , and the judge the judges who supervise independent counsels ratified Judge <PERSON_1>Reno</PERSON_1> 's , Attorney General <PERSON_2>Reno</PERSON_2> 's request that <PERSON_3>Starr</PERSON_3> be given the new authority .
These interviews the President has been giving today to <ORGANIZATION_1>Public Broadcasting</ORGANIZATION_1> and <ORGANIZATION_2>National Public Radio</ORGANIZATION_2> were all sort of pre-fixed because they were in preparation for the President 's State of the Union .
One of the people you 've already heard of this evening who questioned the President was <ORGANIZATION_1>National Public Radio</ORGANIZATION_1> 's <PERSON_2>Mara Liasson</PERSON_2> .
And he was more unequivocal in his denials with us than he had been with <PERSON_1>Jim Lehrer</PERSON_1> of <ORGANIZATION_2>Public Broadcasting</ORGANIZATION_2> .
Let 's go back to <PERSON_1>Sam Donaldson</PERSON_1> at the <ORGANIZATION_2>White House</ORGANIZATION_2> .
The danger is that more evidence would pile up that the President had suggested that this young woman lie under oath or that he had <PERSON_1>Vernon Jordan</PERSON_1> or someone else do that .
Okay , <PERSON_1>Sam</PERSON_1> , thanks very much and everybody else in <LOCATION_2>Washington</LOCATION_2> and <LOCATION_3>New York</LOCATION_3> , good night as one would hope , from the <ORGANIZATION_4>White House</ORGANIZATION_4> 's point of view , I meant one would think from the <ORGANIZATION_5>White House</ORGANIZATION_5> 's point of view that with all these denials , he might be a bit more relaxed .
And he didn 't waste any time today telling the <LOCATION_1>United States</LOCATION_1> and <LOCATION_2>Cuba</LOCATION_2> , both of them , they should change .
But it has taken <PERSON_1>John Paul The second</PERSON_1> until the twilight years of his papacy to finally come to <LOCATION_2>Cuba</LOCATION_2> .
But for him to come here , where the <ORGANIZATION_1>Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION_1> has been hampered and restricted for so many years , where this past Christmas celebration was the first one since nineteen fifty-nine , where he will surely be compelled to talk about the American blockade of <LOCATION_2>Cuba</LOCATION_2> , where you can feel <LOCATION_3>Cuba</LOCATION_3> straining to change , now this is a big moment here .
<PERSON_1>John Paul</PERSON_1> is too frail now to kneel down and kiss the ground .
<PERSON_1>John Paul</PERSON_1> 's response sounded in part like a direct call for democracy in <LOCATION_2>Cuba</LOCATION_2> , telling Cubans to control their own history .
Asked if he had a message for the <LOCATION_1>US</LOCATION_1> about its embargo of <LOCATION_2>Cuba</LOCATION_2> , he said to change .
When reporters asked him what he wants to hear from the Cuban president , <PERSON_1>John Paul</PERSON_1> said simply , the truth .
Somebody looking at this saw <PERSON_1>Fidel Castro</PERSON_1> in a suit said , in <LOCATION_2>Cuba</LOCATION_2> that 's the first time .
<PERSON_1>Conchita Diaz</PERSON_1> did and was welcomed at hers .
<PERSON_1>Patricia Rotea Galindo</PERSON_1> came to <LOCATION_2>Havana</LOCATION_2> to look for a life she left behind when she was ten , and she found it in a graveyard .
We 'll be back in <LOCATION_1>Havana</LOCATION_1> later in the broadcast .
And a familiar name is involved , <PERSON_1>John Gotti</PERSON_1> .
He was among forty alleged members of the <PERSON_1>Gambino</PERSON_1> crime family indicted by the government .
They say that <PERSON_1>John Gotti</PERSON_1> followed in his father 's footsteps by becoming a mob boss .
The case began when investigators planted bugs in the home of <PERSON_1>Gregory DePalma</PERSON_1> , an aging soldier in the <PERSON_2>Gambino</PERSON_2> family .
And there were new scams , a sophisticated phone card fraud involving former pitcher <PERSON_1>Denny MacLaine</PERSON_1> and a deal where the mob used minority workers to demand no-show jobs from construction contractors .
<PERSON_1>John Miller</PERSON_1> , <ORGANIZATION_2>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_2> , <LOCATION_3>New York</LOCATION_3> .
Chief weapons inspector <PERSON_1>Richard Butler</PERSON_1> left <LOCATION_2>Baghdad</LOCATION_2> today after getting nowhere in two days of talks .
Palestinian leader <PERSON_1>Yasser Arafat</PERSON_1> arrived in <LOCATION_2>Washington</LOCATION_2> today for talks about the <LOCATION_3>Middle East</LOCATION_3> peace process .
And tomorrow , he 'll be at the <ORGANIZATION_1>White House</ORGANIZATION_1> for a meeting with President <PERSON_2>Clinton</PERSON_2> .
The <ORGANIZATION_1>Federal Reserve</ORGANIZATION_1> said that while the <LOCATION_2>US</LOCATION_2> economy is still growing at a moderate pace , manufacturers report a decrease in Asian demand for <LOCATION_3>US</LOCATION_3> goods .
And <PERSON_1>Peter</PERSON_1> will be back from <LOCATION_2>Havana</LOCATION_2> in a moment .
<PERSON_1>Fidel</PERSON_1> never came .
It has always been harder for outsiders to get a precise fix on what <PERSON_1>Fidel Castro</PERSON_1> is going to do or really thinks about his relationship with the <LOCATION_2>United States</LOCATION_2> .
<PERSON_1>Ricardo Alarcon</PERSON_1> is the president of the <ORGANIZATION_2>Cuban National Assembly</ORGANIZATION_2> .
I have heard Cuban analysts say before that the best thing President <PERSON_1>Clinton</PERSON_1> could do for Cubans is to lift the embargo because , ultimately , it would undermine the governmental authority of President <PERSON_2>Castro</PERSON_2> .
Good night from <LOCATION_1>Central Park</LOCATION_1> , <LOCATION_2>Havana</LOCATION_2> 's <LOCATION_3>Central Park</LOCATION_3> .
From <ORGANIZATION_1>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_1> world headquarters in <LOCATION_2>New York</LOCATION_2> , Thursday , January twenty-second , this is World News Tonight with <PERSON_3>Peter Jennings</PERSON_3> .
The presidential entourage has dutifully tried to circle the wagons , but morale at the <ORGANIZATION_1>White House</ORGANIZATION_1> is not good .
So let 's go to our <ORGANIZATION_1>White House</ORGANIZATION_1> correspondent first , <PERSON_2>Sam Donaldson</PERSON_2> .
The President spoke during a photo opportunity with visiting Palestinian leader <PERSON_1>Yasser Arafat</PERSON_1> .
Later , <PERSON_1>Vernon Jordan</PERSON_1> , the President 's close friend , surfaced before the microphones to deny he has done anything wrong in his dealings with <PERSON_2>Monica Lewinsky</PERSON_2> .
<PERSON_1>Jordan</PERSON_1> said presidential secretary <PERSON_2>Betty Currie</PERSON_2> referred <PERSON_3>Lewinsky</PERSON_3> to him , and he tried to help her find employment at <ORGANIZATION_4>Revlon</ORGANIZATION_4> and at <ORGANIZATION_5>American Express</ORGANIZATION_5> .
His worst moment coming on the subject of <PERSON_1>Gennifer Flowers</PERSON_1> , who <PERSON_2>Clinton</PERSON_2> talked about back in nineteen ninety-two on Sixty Minutes .
The independent counsel has sent over other subpoenas , one for <PERSON_1>Betty Currie</PERSON_1> , the presidential secretary .
<PERSON_1>Sam Donaldson</PERSON_1> at the <ORGANIZATION_2>White House</ORGANIZATION_2> tonight .
So much depends on what <PERSON_1>Monica Lewinsky</PERSON_1> does or says , more specifically , next .
<PERSON_1>Monica Lewinsky</PERSON_1> 's lawyer , <PERSON_2>William Ginsburg</PERSON_2> , arrived in <LOCATION_3>Washington</LOCATION_3> late today to prepare his client for whatever comes next .
We have a hearing tonight with the judge in <LOCATION_1>Arkansas</LOCATION_1> , Judge <PERSON_2>Wright</PERSON_2> , and she will determine then whether the hearing is going to go forward .
<PERSON_1>Ginsburg</PERSON_1> wants it delayed because <PERSON_2>Lewinsky</PERSON_2> is now so embroiled in <PERSON_3>Ken Starr</PERSON_3> 's criminal investigation , and he wants some time , possibly to strike a deal with <PERSON_4>Starr</PERSON_4> .
<ORGANIZATION_1>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_1> learned today , that after <PERSON_2>Lewinsky</PERSON_2> was confronted at this hotel by investigators and told there were tapes of her allegations against the President , she was offered leniency if she agreed to wear a wire and secretly tape conversations of others , presumably , <PERSON_3>Vernon Jordan</PERSON_3> , <PERSON_4>Clinton</PERSON_4> 's secretary and possibly the President himself .
There were more developments today regarding this document , obtained by <ORGANIZATION_1>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_1> .
<PERSON_1>Tripp</PERSON_1> also had been subpoenaed by lawyers for <PERSON_2>Paula Jones</PERSON_2> , and this document contains talking points , instructions for how to answer their questions .
About <PERSON_1>Lewinsky</PERSON_1> , it is suggested that <PERSON_2>Tripp</PERSON_2> say she found out <PERSON_3>Lewinsky</PERSON_3> left the <ORGANIZATION_4>White House</ORGANIZATION_4> because she was stalking President , not because she was having an affair with him .
Thanks very much , <PERSON_1>Jackie Judd</PERSON_1> in <LOCATION_2>Washington</LOCATION_2> .
In President <PERSON_1>Kennedy</PERSON_1> 's day , <PERSON_2>Bill Clinton</PERSON_2> 's idol , the President 's personal relationships inside the <ORGANIZATION_3>White House</ORGANIZATION_3> were ignored by the press .
So where does <PERSON_1>Monica Lewinsky</PERSON_1> fit in ?
She was like many kids at <ORGANIZATION_1>Beverly Hills High School</ORGANIZATION_1> , the product of a bitter divorce .
She later went to <LOCATION_1>Portland</LOCATION_1> , <LOCATION_2>Oregon</LOCATION_2> , where she graduated as a psychology major from <ORGANIZATION_3>Lewis and Clark College</ORGANIZATION_3> .
<PERSON_1>Linda Douglass</PERSON_1> , <ORGANIZATION_2>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_2> , <LOCATION_3>Washington</LOCATION_3> .
The <PERSON_1>Unabomber</PERSON_1> 's confession , <PERSON_2>Ted Kaczynski</PERSON_2> admits everything .
In <LOCATION_1>California</LOCATION_1> , the trial of the <PERSON_2>Unabomber</PERSON_2> has come to an abrupt end , just as opening statements were about to start .
In <LOCATION_1>Sacramento</LOCATION_1> , first of all , here 's <ORGANIZATION_2>ABC</ORGANIZATION_2> 's <PERSON_3>Ken Kashiwahara</PERSON_3> .
And the <ORGANIZATION_1>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION_1> had insisted on pursuing the death penalty , believing <PERSON_2>Kaczynski</PERSON_2> to be sane .
All , <PERSON_1>Kaczynski</PERSON_1> 's attorneys had all but conceded his guilt and planned to convince the jury he should be spared the death penalty .
<PERSON_1>Ken Kashiwahara</PERSON_1> , <ORGANIZATION_2>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_2> , <LOCATION_3>Sacramento</LOCATION_3> .
It is for <PERSON_1>Ted Kaczynski</PERSON_1> in this trial .
<PERSON_1>Terry Moran</PERSON_1> in <LOCATION_2>Sacramento</LOCATION_2> , along with <PERSON_3>Ken Kashiwahara</PERSON_3> .
<ORGANIZATION_1>ABC</ORGANIZATION_1> 's national security correspondent <PERSON_2>John McWethy</PERSON_2> has more .
Sources tell <ORGANIZATION_1>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_1> that the Americans who conducted this operation are part of a highly secret commando unit that the <ORGANIZATION_2>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION_2> has denied even exists .
<PERSON_1>John McWethy</PERSON_1> , <ORGANIZATION_2>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_2> , the <ORGANIZATION_3>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION_3> .
On Wall Street today , the <ORGANIZATION_1>Dow Jones</ORGANIZATION_1> Industrials lost more than sixty-three points to close at seventy-seven thirty .
Tonight , c closer look at the other man in this <ORGANIZATION_1>White House</ORGANIZATION_1> crisis , <PERSON_2>Vernon Jordan</PERSON_2> .
<ORGANIZATION_1>ABC</ORGANIZATION_1> 's <PERSON_2>Chris Wallace</PERSON_2> has covered him for years .
<PERSON_1>Clinton</PERSON_1> has turned to the sixty-two year old <PERSON_2>Jordan</PERSON_2> often to help steer him out of trouble .
On the night <ORGANIZATION_1>White House</ORGANIZATION_1> official <PERSON_2>Vincent Foster</PERSON_2> shot himself , <PERSON_3>Jordan</PERSON_3> was at the President 's side .
But sometimes the President 's problems have become problems for <PERSON_1>Jordan</PERSON_1> .
When <PERSON_1>Webster Hubbell</PERSON_1> left the <ORGANIZATION_2>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION_2> , <PERSON_3>Jordan</PERSON_3> reportedly helped line up jobs for him .
According to sources who have heard the secret tapes , <PERSON_1>Monica Lewinsky</PERSON_1> says <PERSON_2>Jordan</PERSON_2> told her to lie about her relationship with the President , and <PERSON_3>Jordan</PERSON_3> admitted today he tried to help her get a job , although he made it sound like just a good deed .
But in nineteen eighty-one , <PERSON_1>Jordan</PERSON_1> changed careers .
Now he wears shirts handmade in <LOCATION_1>London</LOCATION_1> and drives a red <ORGANIZATION_2>Cadillac</ORGANIZATION_2> , and one black activist has written of what he calls <PERSON_3>Vernon Jordan</PERSON_3> disease , powerful blacks who forget their roots and leave their people behind .
A longtime <LOCATION_1>Washington</LOCATION_1> insider put it this way , <PERSON_2>Vernon Jordan</PERSON_2> might go right up to the line , but he won 't go to jail for the President or anyone else .
Our legal analyst <PERSON_1>Jeff Toobin</PERSON_1> is here .
And that means , in this case , that <PERSON_1>Ken Starr</PERSON_1> would have to prove that <PERSON_2>Vernon Jordan</PERSON_2> intended that <PERSON_3>Monica Lewinsky</PERSON_3> lie in her deposition .
Well , the next important step , it seems to me , is <PERSON_1>Monica Lewinsky</PERSON_1> 's deposition in the <PERSON_2>Paula Jones</PERSON_2> case .
Finally this evening , Pope <PERSON_1>John Paul</PERSON_1> .
<ORGANIZATION_1>ABC</ORGANIZATION_1> 's <PERSON_2>Bill Blakemore</PERSON_2> is still there .
And <PERSON_1>John Paul</PERSON_1> criticized the government , said its economic system creates poverty whose pressures tear families apart , even make them leave the country .
The Pope 's critique was actually heard by millions in <LOCATION_1>Cuba</LOCATION_1> because <PERSON_2>Fidel Castro</PERSON_2> made a last minute decision to televise this Mass nationwide , a risk he 's willing to take for the benefits of hosting <PERSON_3>John Paul</PERSON_3> .
<PERSON_1>Bill Blakemore</PERSON_1> , <ORGANIZATION_2>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_2> , <LOCATION_3>Santa Clara</LOCATION_3> , <LOCATION_4>Cuba</LOCATION_4> .
Fairly obvious , President <PERSON_1>Clinton</PERSON_1> denied again today that he had an affair with <ORGANIZATION_2>White House</ORGANIZATION_2> intern <PERSON_3>Monica Lewinsky</PERSON_3> , and the President 's close friend <PERSON_4>Vernon Jordan</PERSON_4> said he never asked <PERSON_5>Lewinsky</PERSON_5> to lie .
I 'm <PERSON_1>Peter Jennings</PERSON_1> .
From <ORGANIZATION_1>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_1> world headquarters in <LOCATION_2>New York</LOCATION_2> , Friday January twenty-third , this is World News Tonight with <PERSON_3>Peter Jennings</PERSON_3> .
Today , someone with specific knowledge of what it is that <PERSON_1>Monica Lewinsky</PERSON_1> says really took place between her and the President has been talking to <ORGANIZATION_2>ABC</ORGANIZATION_2> 's <PERSON_3>Jackie Judd</PERSON_3> .
The source says <PERSON_1>Monica Lewinsky</PERSON_1> claims she would visit the <ORGANIZATION_2>White House</ORGANIZATION_2> for sex with <PERSON_3>Clinton</PERSON_3> in the early evening or early mornings on the weekends , when certain aides who would find her presence disturbing were not at the office .
And what was <PERSON_1>Lewinsky</PERSON_1> told to say about the affair after receiving a subpoena from lawyers for <PERSON_2>Paula Jones</PERSON_2> ?
<ORGANIZATION_1>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_1> has obtained documents which confirm that <PERSON_2>Lewinsky</PERSON_2> made efforts to stay in contact with the President after she left the <ORGANIZATION_3>White House</ORGANIZATION_3> .
The packages were sent to the southwest gate with a contact number for <PERSON_1>Betty Currie</PERSON_1> , the President 's personal secretary .
Another package sent to <PERSON_1>Vernon Jordan</PERSON_1> 's law firm , we are told , contained a list of jobs that <PERSON_2>Lewinsky</PERSON_2> would be interested in .
Her attorney , <PERSON_1>William Ginsburg</PERSON_1> , today accused investigators from independent counsel <PERSON_2>Ken Starr</PERSON_2> 's office of putting the squeeze on <PERSON_3>Lewinsky</PERSON_3> to win her cooperation .
After he had the the wire material , he lured Miss <PERSON_1>Lewinsky</PERSON_1> to the <ORGANIZATION_2>Ritz Carlton</ORGANIZATION_2> hotel in <LOCATION_3>Pentagon City</LOCATION_3> and , with the help of four or five <ORGANIZATION_4>FBI</ORGANIZATION_4> agents and three or four <LOCATION_5>US</LOCATION_5> attorneys , managed to detain her , although she was technically free to go , for eight or nine hours without an attorney .
We 've learned , <PERSON_1>Peter</PERSON_1> , that tomorrow , <PERSON_2>Starr</PERSON_2> and <PERSON_3>Ginsburg</PERSON_3> will meet about cutting a deal and getting <PERSON_4>Monica Lewinsky</PERSON_4> to cooperate in this criminal investigation .
While the lawyers and certainly reporters have been focused on the allegations of illicit sex and allegations that <PERSON_1>Monica Lewinsky</PERSON_1> was encouraged to lie on the President 's behalf , and these are still allegations we are dealing with , the President 's staff has been trying to wrench the country 's attention back to his political agenda .
<PERSON_1>Sam</PERSON_1> and <PERSON_2>Peter</PERSON_2> , it hasn 't been easy for him , right ?
And it was left to presidential spokesman <PERSON_1>Mike McCurry</PERSON_1> to bring things back to reality .
<PERSON_1>Sam Donaldson</PERSON_1> at the <ORGANIZATION_2>White House</ORGANIZATION_2> tonight .
What about <PERSON_1>Clinton</PERSON_1> ?
<PERSON_1>Linda</PERSON_1> tell <ORGANIZATION_2>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_2> that <PERSON_3>Clinton</PERSON_3> is handling these latest allegations with steely resolve .
But for <PERSON_1>Clinton</PERSON_1> , it may have been like a scene from a recurring nightmare in which she is forced to fight charges that her husband is a womanizer as she has done before .
<ORGANIZATION_1>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_1> has learned that <PERSON_2>Clinton</PERSON_2> is consulting and calling a close circle of friends and advisors trying to develop a strategy .
<PERSON_1>Linda Douglass</PERSON_1> in <LOCATION_2>Washington</LOCATION_2> tonight .
They say that <PERSON_1>Clinton</PERSON_1> is being victimized by the independent counsel , <PERSON_2>Kenneth Starr</PERSON_2> , who is a Republican out to get him , they say .
How does he get from investigating a <ORGANIZATION_1>Whitewater</ORGANIZATION_1> land deal to allegations of sex and cover up ?
But with court approval , it has been expanded repeatedly , to <PERSON_1>Web Hubbell</PERSON_1> , then number two at the <ORGANIZATION_2>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION_2> , who <PERSON_3>Starr</PERSON_3> convicted of bilking clients while a lawyer years earlier in <LOCATION_4>Arkansas</LOCATION_4> , to improprieties at the <ORGANIZATION_5>White House Travel Office</ORGANIZATION_5> , misuse of <ORGANIZATION_6>FBI</ORGANIZATION_6> files , <PERSON_7>Vince Foster</PERSON_7> 's suicide , and now to suggestions of obstruction of justice in the <PERSON_8>Lewinsky</PERSON_8> case .
<PERSON_1>Lawrence Walsh</PERSON_1> was the independent counsel in <LOCATION_2>Iran</LOCATION_2> .
He says <PERSON_1>Starr</PERSON_1> 's investigation may be legal , but that it 's inappropriate for him to interfere in <PERSON_2>Paula Jones</PERSON_2> ' pending civil suit in which <PERSON_3>Monica Lewinsky</PERSON_3> is a witness .
President <PERSON_1>Bush</PERSON_1> made him solicitor general , his administration 's top courtroom advocate .
If people don 't understand how the <ORGANIZATION_1>Whitewater</ORGANIZATION_1> investigation in <LOCATION_2>Little Rock</LOCATION_2> has stretched to a sex and perjury scandal in <LOCATION_3>Washington</LOCATION_3> , <PERSON_4>Starr</PERSON_4> himself has done little to help .
<PERSON_1>Tim O 'Brien</PERSON_1> , <ORGANIZATION_2>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_2> , <LOCATION_3>Washington</LOCATION_3> .
But le t 's put it to our legal analyst <PERSON_1>Jeffrey Toobin</PERSON_1> .
He is investigating this case at the request of <PERSON_1>Janet Reno</PERSON_1> and with court approval .
Legal analyst <PERSON_1>Jeff Toobin</PERSON_1> .
This certainly concerns the <ORGANIZATION_1>White House</ORGANIZATION_1> .
<LOCATION_1>Rocky Mountain</LOCATION_1> high , <LOCATION_2>Colorado</LOCATION_2> .
I think <PERSON_1>Clinton</PERSON_1> , he will be redeemed .

Today , the chief <ORGANIZATION_1>UN</ORGANIZATION_1> inspector <PERSON_2>Richard Butler</PERSON_2> told the <ORGANIZATION_3>UN Security Council</ORGANIZATION_3> that <LOCATION_4>Iraq</LOCATION_4> is no longer willing to cooperate with his weapons inspectors .
The Secretary of State <PERSON_1>Madeleine Albright</PERSON_1> said that the <LOCATION_2>United States</LOCATION_2> would start consulting its allies about using military force , even though most of them are reluctant .
<PERSON_1>Mir Aimal Kasi</PERSON_1> has said that he intended to assassinate the <ORGANIZATION_2>CIA</ORGANIZATION_2> director , but he settled on commuters instead .
<ORGANIZATION_1>ABC</ORGANIZATION_1> 's <PERSON_2>Barry Serafin</PERSON_2> focuses on a <LOCATION_3>US</LOCATION_3> consulate in <LOCATION_4>Brazil</LOCATION_4> .
It was in <LOCATION_1>Sao Paulo</LOCATION_1> , <LOCATION_2>Brazil</LOCATION_2> , that the <ORGANIZATION_3>State Department</ORGANIZATION_3> guidelines were first brought to light .
The <ORGANIZATION_1>State Department</ORGANIZATION_1> denies rejecting visas on the basis of race but acknowledges it does use guidelines like those in <LOCATION_2>Sao Paulo</LOCATION_2> and says it will continue to use them .

A source has told <ORGANIZATION_1>ABC</ORGANIZATION_1> 's <PERSON_2>Jackie Judd</PERSON_2> more details about the alleged affair between <PERSON_3>Monica Lewinsky</PERSON_3> and the President .
Later this evening , Twenty Twenty and Nightline will have the latest on the crisis in the <ORGANIZATION_1>White House</ORGANIZATION_1> .
So I 'm <PERSON_1>Peter Jennings</PERSON_1> .
The former <ORGANIZATION_1>White House</ORGANIZATION_1> intern who could challenge President <PERSON_2>Clinton</PERSON_2> 's sworn testimony once again talking a deal with the special prosecutor , and close friends and advisors rush to offer their advice to the President as the <ORGANIZATION_3>White House</ORGANIZATION_3> sinks deeper into crisis .
Here 's <PERSON_1>Forrest Sawyer</PERSON_1> .
A new <ORGANIZATION_1>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_1> poll today shows less than half of Americans believe <PERSON_2>Clinton</PERSON_2> has quote the honesty and integrity to serve effectively .
We have several reports , beginning with <ORGANIZATION_1>ABC</ORGANIZATION_1> 's <PERSON_2>Jackie Judd</PERSON_2> in <LOCATION_3>Washington</LOCATION_3> .
The struggle between independent counsel <PERSON_1>Ken Starr</PERSON_1> and lawyer <PERSON_2>William Ginsburg</PERSON_2> about <PERSON_3>Monica Lewinsky</PERSON_3> 's future reached no resolution today .
Because <PERSON_1>Starr</PERSON_1> could potentially bring such charges as perjury and obstruction of justice against <PERSON_2>Lewinsky</PERSON_2> , some analysts say that he has the upper hand .
But he also knows that <PERSON_1>Monica Lewinsky</PERSON_1> desperately needs the protection of the independent counsel .
And <PERSON_1>Starr</PERSON_1> seems hell bent on getting President <PERSON_2>Clinton</PERSON_2> .
A source tells <ORGANIZATION_1>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_1> that <PERSON_2>Lewinsky</PERSON_2> consented to having <ORGANIZATION_3>FBI</ORGANIZATION_3> agents go through her apartment at the <ORGANIZATION_4>Watergate</ORGANIZATION_4> on Thursday for evidence related to the alleged affair with <PERSON_5>Clinton</PERSON_5> .
Today , a <LOCATION_1>New York</LOCATION_1> literary agent admitted that she told <PERSON_2>Tripp</PERSON_2> to tape the calls as a way of protecting herself if all of this became public .
<PERSON_1>Forrest</PERSON_1> and <PERSON_2>Jackie Judd</PERSON_2> in <LOCATION_3>Washington</LOCATION_3> .
<ORGANIZATION_1>ABC</ORGANIZATION_1> 's <PERSON_2>Sam Donaldson</PERSON_2> joins us with the latest from the <ORGANIZATION_3>White House</ORGANIZATION_3> .
The President 's <LOCATION_1>Hollywood</LOCATION_1> friend <PERSON_2>Harry Thomasson</PERSON_2> , who 's given advice in the past on public relations , spent the night .
Even <PERSON_1>Harold Ickes</PERSON_1> , who left after the first term , disappointed he 'd not been made chief of staff , is said to be lending a hand on an unpaid basis .
In fact , <PERSON_1>Leon Panetta</PERSON_1> , his former chief of staff , today called the scandal a crisis for the party and said if the charges are not baseless , it would be better if Vice President <PERSON_2>Gore</PERSON_2> became president now .
Party chairman <PERSON_1>Roy Romer</PERSON_1> , in an interview with <ORGANIZATION_2>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_2> , appeared horrified at even being asked to comment on <PERSON_3>Panetta</PERSON_3> 's advice .
Along with other national security officials , <PERSON_1>Gore</PERSON_1> attended a full scale meeting on another crisis in <LOCATION_2>Iraq</LOCATION_2> .
<PERSON_1>Forrest</PERSON_1> and <PERSON_2>Sam Donaldson</PERSON_2> at the <ORGANIZATION_3>White House</ORGANIZATION_3> .
Joining us , former <PERSON_1>Clinton</PERSON_1> advisor and <ORGANIZATION_2>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_2> political analyst , <PERSON_3>George Stephanopoulos</PERSON_3> .
And that 's why the secretaries of <ORGANIZATION_1>State</ORGANIZATION_1> , <ORGANIZATION_2>Defense</ORGANIZATION_2> , the vice president today were meeting on <LOCATION_3>Iraq</LOCATION_3> .
<ORGANIZATION_1>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_1> political analyst <PERSON_2>George Stephanopoulos</PERSON_2> .
Here 's <ORGANIZATION_1>ABC</ORGANIZATION_1> 's <PERSON_2>Mike Lee</PERSON_2> .
It rocked most of the world , from <LOCATION_1>Jerusalem</LOCATION_1> , to <LOCATION_2>Moscow</LOCATION_2> , to <LOCATION_3>Berlin</LOCATION_3> .
In <LOCATION_1>France</LOCATION_1> , where the media virtually ignored the late President <PERSON_2>Mitterrand</PERSON_2> 's illegitimate child , many shrug off allegations against President <PERSON_3>Clinton</PERSON_3> .
<PERSON_1>Mike Lee</PERSON_1> , <ORGANIZATION_2>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_2> , <LOCATION_3>London</LOCATION_3> .
Still ahead on World News Tonight this Saturday , how Vice President <PERSON_1>Gore</PERSON_1> is handling the crisis in the <ORGANIZATION_2>White House</ORGANIZATION_2> .
<PERSON_1>Al Gore</PERSON_1> and <PERSON_2>Bill Clinton</PERSON_2> are good friends , but in this crisis they may very well find themselves on different sides of the fence .
There was no press access to the Vice President when he arrived at the <ORGANIZATION_1>White House</ORGANIZATION_1> late this afternoon .
It does not do the <ORGANIZATION_1>Democratic party</ORGANIZATION_1> any good , it certainly doesn 't do the Vice President any good .
His schedule is unchanged , including a dinner here tonight at his residence with <ORGANIZATION_1>House</ORGANIZATION_1> monority leader and one time <PERSON_2>Clinton</PERSON_2> opponent , <PERSON_3>Richard Gephardt</PERSON_3> .
<PERSON_1>Karla Davis</PERSON_1> , <ORGANIZATION_2>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_2> , <LOCATION_3>Washington</LOCATION_3> .
I mean , that 's why they call him <PERSON_1>Slick Willy</PERSON_1> .
It is part of a pattern of nuanced responses to everyday moral dilemmas that has characterized <PERSON_1>Clinton</PERSON_1> 's career .
Including for example , <LOCATION_1>Virginia</LOCATION_1> Senator <PERSON_2>Chuck Robb</PERSON_2> , who accused of infidelity also said he had not quite slept with the other woman .
<PERSON_1>Michel McQueen</PERSON_1> , <ORGANIZATION_2>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_2> , the <ORGANIZATION_3>White House</ORGANIZATION_3> .
We will have more on the crisis tomorrow morning on This Week with <PERSON_1>Sam</PERSON_1> and <PERSON_2>Cokie</PERSON_2> , <ORGANIZATION_3>White House</ORGANIZATION_3> reaction to the crisis from one of President <PERSON_4>Clinton</PERSON_4> 's closest advisors , <PERSON_5>Paul Begala</PERSON_5> .
In <LOCATION_1>Cuba</LOCATION_1> today , tens of thousands of people turned out to see Pope <PERSON_2>John Paul</PERSON_2> , the largest gathering so far in his five day visit .
Here 's <ORGANIZATION_1>ABC</ORGANIZATION_1> 's <PERSON_2>Bill Blakemore</PERSON_2> .
<PERSON_1>Fidel Castro</PERSON_1> is allowing this and all of <PERSON_2>John Paul</PERSON_2> 's masses here in <LOCATION_3>Cuba</LOCATION_3> to be televised nationwide .
The dictator has appeared deeply respectful of Pope <PERSON_1>John Paul</PERSON_1> on TV here .
<PERSON_1>Fidel Castro</PERSON_1> is apparently hoping for new international prestige in return for welcoming <PERSON_2>John Paul</PERSON_2> .
<PERSON_1>Bill Blakemore</PERSON_1> , <ORGANIZATION_2>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_2> , with the Pope in <LOCATION_3>Cuba</LOCATION_3> .
In <LOCATION_1>San Diego</LOCATION_1> tomorrow , the <ORGANIZATION_2>Green Bay Packers</ORGANIZATION_2> take on the <ORGANIZATION_3>Denver Broncos</ORGANIZATION_3> .
The <ORGANIZATION_1>Denver Broncos</ORGANIZATION_1> put themselves into the end zone , into the winners ' circle and into the big game again .
The only obstacle , the <ORGANIZATION_1>Green Bay Packers</ORGANIZATION_1> , an undeniably great team .
So , despite the predictions , <LOCATION_1>Denver</LOCATION_1> fans are printing up their T shirts and praying that somehow they can break the Super Bowl curse and win at last .
<PERSON_1>Tom Foreman</PERSON_1> , <ORGANIZATION_2>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_2> , <LOCATION_3>Denver</LOCATION_3> .
<ORGANIZATION_1>ABC</ORGANIZATION_1> 's <PERSON_2>John Martin</PERSON_2> reports on the media in full battle mode .
The President 's press secretary , <PERSON_1>Mike McCurry</PERSON_1> , issued in the new media world of cable and internet , it 's all <PERSON_2>Lewinsky</PERSON_2> , all the time .
Not the <PERSON_1>Monica Lewinsky</PERSON_1> that I knew ?
They don 't pay at <ORGANIZATION_1>US News and World Report</ORGANIZATION_1> but it 's looking for facts in a hurry , too .
<PERSON_1>John Martin</PERSON_1> , <ORGANIZATION_2>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_2> , <LOCATION_3>Washington</LOCATION_3> .
Trying to understand this <ORGANIZATION_1>White House</ORGANIZATION_1> crisis , there are people who believe the presidency is really in jeopardy .
Tomorrow , Good Morning America Sunday and This Week with <PERSON_1>Sam</PERSON_1> and <PERSON_2>Cokie</PERSON_2> .
<PERSON_1>Monica Lewinsky</PERSON_1> seen but not heard .
Reporting tonight from <LOCATION_1>Washington</LOCATION_1> .
Miss <PERSON_1>Lewinsky</PERSON_1> and her lawyer are negotiating today with the independent counsel about the basis on which she might testify to this alleged affair .
So we 're going to begin tonight 's reporting with <PERSON_1>Sam Donaldson</PERSON_1> , who 's at the <ORGANIZATION_2>White House</ORGANIZATION_2> .
At a <ORGANIZATION_1>White House</ORGANIZATION_1> ceremony on child care programs presided over by his wife which he had not planned to attend , <PERSON_2>Clinton</PERSON_2> stepped forward to make an emotional and somewhat angry statement .
It was left to press secretary <PERSON_2>Mike McCurry</PERSON_2> to dodge a barrage of questions .
When <PERSON_1>Gennifer Flowers</PERSON_1> made that claim back in nineteen ninety two , she produced audio tapes on which <PERSON_2>Clinton</PERSON_2> is heard apparently telling her to lie about it .
<PERSON_1>Sam</PERSON_1> , I have one more question about the <ORGANIZATION_2>White House</ORGANIZATION_2> , but just hang on for one sec , if you would .
So here is <ORGANIZATION_1>ABC</ORGANIZATION_1> 's <PERSON_2>Jackie Judd</PERSON_2> .
Time is running out for negotiations because <PERSON_1>Lewinsky</PERSON_1> has been subpoenaed to appear before <PERSON_2>Starr</PERSON_2> 's grand jury as early as tomorrow .
Sources have told <ORGANIZATION_1>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_1> that <PERSON_2>Starr</PERSON_2> received information that an eyewitness discovered the pair in an intimate moment at the <ORGANIZATION_3>White House</ORGANIZATION_3> in the spring of nineteen ninety six .
The <ORGANIZATION_1>White House</ORGANIZATION_1> spokesman , <PERSON_2>Mike McCurry</PERSON_2> , claimed today that he has been unable to find any staff member aware of such an incident .
But a source with direct knowledge of what <PERSON_1>Lewinsky</PERSON_1> has claimed has provided <ORGANIZATION_2>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_2> with two dates when <PERSON_3>Clinton</PERSON_3> allegedly called her and talked about sex .
It was subpoenas from lawyers for <PERSON_1>Paula Jones</PERSON_1> that led to all these revelations about <PERSON_2>Lewinsky</PERSON_2> .
Today , <PERSON_1>Clinton</PERSON_1> 's lawyer <PERSON_2>Robert Bennett</PERSON_2> argued that <PERSON_3>Clinton</PERSON_3> enemies are using the <PERSON_4>Jones</PERSON_4> ' case to destroy the President .
As for what you are thinking many things , it seems , but the <ORGANIZATION_1>White House</ORGANIZATION_1> is pleased that the President 's job approval rating is still high .
Which takes us back now to <PERSON_1>Sam Donaldson</PERSON_1> at the <ORGANIZATION_2>White House</ORGANIZATION_2> .
That he is going to say no sexual relations period , go up tomorrow night in his State of the Union address , not mention this , according to <ORGANIZATION_1>White House</ORGANIZATION_1> aides .
There 's a photo released by the <ORGANIZATION_1>White House</ORGANIZATION_1> .
Well , not for the first time , amid all the <ORGANIZATION_1>White House</ORGANIZATION_1> turmoil , <LOCATION_2>Iraq</LOCATION_2> was quickly moving up the list on the President 's agenda today .
And so , <ORGANIZATION_1>ABC</ORGANIZATION_1> 's <PERSON_2>John McWethy</PERSON_2> tells us tonight that the clock may really be ticking .
It provides a window of maximum <LOCATION_1>US</LOCATION_1> strength , plus a back up in case <LOCATION_2>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION_2> and <LOCATION_3>Bahrain</LOCATION_3> refuse to allow the <LOCATION_4>US</LOCATION_4> to launch air strikes from their territory .
Among the last bits of string , <LOCATION_1>Moscow</LOCATION_1> has rushed a special envoy to <LOCATION_2>Baghdad</LOCATION_2> , while President <PERSON_3>Yeltsin</PERSON_3> has said <LOCATION_4>Russia</LOCATION_4> strongly opposes military action .
And for those who might think President <PERSON_1>Clinton</PERSON_1> 's sex scandal is paralyzing the government , there was a warning from an unusual quarter today to <PERSON_2>Saddam Hussein</PERSON_2> .
<PERSON_1>John McWethy</PERSON_1> , <ORGANIZATION_2>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_2> , the <ORGANIZATION_3>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION_3> .
In <LOCATION_1>Moscow</LOCATION_1> today , the Russian government said it is now certain that <LOCATION_2>Russia</LOCATION_2> 's last czar , <PERSON_3>Nicholas The second</PERSON_3> , and his family were all executed and their bodies dumped into a pit at the time of the Russian revolution .
News about business today , there are big cutbacks to report today at <ORGANIZATION_1>AT and T</ORGANIZATION_1> .
<ORGANIZATION_1>Compaq</ORGANIZATION_1> says it will buy <ORGANIZATION_2>Digital</ORGANIZATION_2> for nine point six billion dollars .
<LOCATION_1>Smyrna</LOCATION_1> , <LOCATION_2>Georgia</LOCATION_2> , seventy-six cents for a gallon of regular .
<LOCATION_1>Fort Lee</LOCATION_1> , <LOCATION_2>New Jersey</LOCATION_2> , ninety-nine cents .
<PERSON_1>Betsy Stark</PERSON_1> , <ORGANIZATION_2>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_2> , <LOCATION_3>Fort Lee</LOCATION_3> , <LOCATION_4>New Jersey</LOCATION_4> .
We learned today that the <PERSON_1>Kennedys</PERSON_1> are going to give up their last operating business , the <ORGANIZATION_2>Chicago Merchandise Mart</ORGANIZATION_2> , in the family for a long time , basis of fortune .
When we come back , pressure on the <ORGANIZATION_1>White House</ORGANIZATION_1> .
Probably much of the country would like to take a closer look inside the <ORGANIZATION_1>White House</ORGANIZATION_1> tonight to see how the President and his inner circle are really dealing with these challenges to his credibility .
On trade agreement , <ORGANIZATION_1>USTR</ORGANIZATION_1> thinks it 's two forty right now .
Yeah , <PERSON_1>Gene Sperling</PERSON_1> says what so many insiders say , <PERSON_2>Bill Clinton</PERSON_2> has an uncanny ability to focus , no matter what is going on around him .
<PERSON_1>Cokie</PERSON_1> , one assumes that the <ORGANIZATION_2>Congress</ORGANIZATION_2> is going to come back and be polite tomorrow night .
In the week ahead , if things stay pretty much as they are now , how much trouble will the President be in with the <ORGANIZATION_1>Congress</ORGANIZATION_1> ?
President <PERSON_1>Clinton</PERSON_1> said more forcefully today that he did not have a sexual relationship with the <ORGANIZATION_2>White House</ORGANIZATION_2> intern <PERSON_3>Monica Lewinsky</PERSON_3> .
As we heard earlier , the <ORGANIZATION_1>White House</ORGANIZATION_1> is even nervous that its <LOCATION_2>Iraq</LOCATION_2> policy might be perceived to be influenced by the President 's personal problems .
In Wag The Dog , the nation 's President has sex with a young visitor to the <ORGANIZATION_1>White House</ORGANIZATION_1> .
Some <ORGANIZATION_1>White House</ORGANIZATION_1> officials are said to be equally concerned about the portrayal of the President in another movie to be released in March .
A hairdresser has come forward alleging a long-term <LOCATION_1>Hollywood</LOCATION_1> insiders say movie makers aren 't trying to satirize or hurt President <PERSON_2>Clinton</PERSON_2> .
<PERSON_1>Beth Nissen</PERSON_1> , <ORGANIZATION_2>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_2> , <LOCATION_3>New York</LOCATION_3> .
The independent counsel , <PERSON_1>Kenneth Starr</PERSON_1> , says nonsense .
It 's always a big event , this traditional visit to the <ORGANIZATION_1>Congress</ORGANIZATION_1> by the President to report on the state of the nation .
So let 's first go to the <ORGANIZATION_1>White House</ORGANIZATION_1> and <ORGANIZATION_2>ABC</ORGANIZATION_2> 's <PERSON_3>Sam Donaldson</PERSON_3> .
The trouble began this morning when the First Lady showed up for an interview in <LOCATION_1>New York City</LOCATION_1> on the <ORGANIZATION_2>NBC News</ORGANIZATION_2> Today Show , during which she vigorously defended her husband .
<PERSON_1>Starr</PERSON_1> quickly fired back .
<PERSON_1>Peter</PERSON_1> and <PERSON_2>Sam</PERSON_2> , thanks .
In the latest <ORGANIZATION_1>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_1> poll , we find that more people disapprove of the way <PERSON_2>Starr</PERSON_2> is conducting himself .
Along with independent counsel <PERSON_1>Kenneth Starr</PERSON_1> , conservative senators <PERSON_2>Jesse Helms</PERSON_2> and <PERSON_3>Lauch Faircloth</PERSON_3> for their alleged role in supporting <PERSON_4>Starr</PERSON_4> , and conservative activist <PERSON_5>Jerry Falwell</PERSON_5> , whom she accused of peddling a video filled with wild accusations about the <PERSON_6>Clintons</PERSON_6> .
For all the drama of her remarks , <PERSON_1>Clinton</PERSON_1> was alone in their old territory .
While it was widely ridiculed as paranoid when it was leaked , <ORGANIZATION_1>White House</ORGANIZATION_1> spokesman <PERSON_2>Mike McCurry</PERSON_2> defended it .
For example , the conservative <ORGANIZATION_1>Rutherford Institute</ORGANIZATION_1> is funding the <PERSON_2>Paula Jones</PERSON_2> case against the President .
<PERSON_1>Michel McQueen</PERSON_1> , <ORGANIZATION_2>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_2> , <LOCATION_3>Washington</LOCATION_3> .
As for the independent counsel , here in <LOCATION_1>Washington</LOCATION_1> today , the first of numerous witnesses that <PERSON_2>Kenneth Starr</PERSON_2> has subpoenaed in this phase of his investigation appeared before a grand jury .
Here 's <ORGANIZATION_1>ABC</ORGANIZATION_1> 's <PERSON_2>Jackie Judd</PERSON_2> .
She 's relevant to the investigation because it was <PERSON_1>Currie</PERSON_1> whose name and phone number appeared on packages that <PERSON_2>Monica Lewinsky</PERSON_2> sent to the <ORGANIZATION_3>White House</ORGANIZATION_3> and who , according to sources , cleared <PERSON_4>Lewinsky</PERSON_4> into the <ORGANIZATION_5>White House</ORGANIZATION_5> to visit <PERSON_6>Clinton</PERSON_6> .
And it was <PERSON_1>Betty Currie</PERSON_1> , according to <PERSON_2>Vernon Jordan</PERSON_2> , who asked him to help <PERSON_3>Lewinsky</PERSON_3> find a job .
Today , <ORGANIZATION_1>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_1> learned more about what <PERSON_2>Lewinsky</PERSON_2> said when she was secretly taped by investigators .
And she allegedly urged <PERSON_1>Tripp</PERSON_1> to meet with <PERSON_2>Clinton</PERSON_2> 's attorney , <PERSON_3>Robert Bennett</PERSON_3> .
Thank you , <PERSON_1>Peter</PERSON_1> and <PERSON_2>Jackie Judd</PERSON_2> .
In the early edition of the Dallas Morning News , it was reported that a <ORGANIZATION_1>Secret Service</ORGANIZATION_1> agent was prepared to testify that he had seen the President and <PERSON_2>Monica Lewinsky</PERSON_2> in an intimate situation .
Now , the <LOCATION_1>United States</LOCATION_1> and <LOCATION_2>Iraq</LOCATION_2> .
The secretary of <ORGANIZATION_1>Department of Home Affairs</ORGANIZATION_1> leaves this week for <LOCATION_2>Europe</LOCATION_2> and the <LOCATION_3>Middle East</LOCATION_3> .
<ORGANIZATION_1>ABC</ORGANIZATION_1> 's <PERSON_2>John McWethy</PERSON_2> reports for us tonight about the urgency .
Every week that passes , <PERSON_1>Saddam Hussein</PERSON_1> adds enough anthrax to his stocks in order to fill two warheads on missiles .
<PERSON_1>John McWethy</PERSON_1> , <ORGANIZATION_2>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_2> , the <ORGANIZATION_3>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION_3> .
Pharmaceutical giant <ORGANIZATION_1>Smith Kline Beecham</ORGANIZATION_1> says it will try to eliminate the disfiguring disease by distributing the drug albendazole to the one billion people worldwide who are at risk .
It is ironic that so many more Americans than usual may watch the President 's State of the Union address tonight to see what the reaction is on Capitol Hill to <PERSON_1>Clinton</PERSON_1> 's political crisis .
<PERSON_1>Catherine Doar</PERSON_1> is a twenty-seven year old film researcher who pays eighty dollars per paycheck to Social Security .
<PERSON_1>Betsy Stark</PERSON_1> , <ORGANIZATION_2>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_2> , <LOCATION_3>New York</LOCATION_3> .
Every day , more than half of all infants and toddlers in <LOCATION_1>America</LOCATION_1> spend the day in the care of someone other than their parents .

On Wall Street today , the <ORGANIZATION_1>Dow Jones</ORGANIZATION_1> Industrials gained a hundred and two points to close at seventy-eight fifteen .
When we come back , we 'll talk to <PERSON_1>Sam Donaldson</PERSON_1> and <PERSON_2>Cokie Roberts</PERSON_2> a bit about how the President may be received on Capitol Hill tonight .
<ORGANIZATION_1>Republicans</ORGANIZATION_1> and <ORGANIZATION_2>Democrats</ORGANIZATION_2> are very aware that the country will be watching them carefully .
The Republican Speaker of the <ORGANIZATION_1>House</ORGANIZATION_1> , <PERSON_2>Gingrich</PERSON_2> , The President of the <LOCATION_3>United States</LOCATION_3> will be an honored guest to the <ORGANIZATION_4>House</ORGANIZATION_4> and <ORGANIZATION_5>Senate</ORGANIZATION_5> .
<PERSON_1>Cokie</PERSON_1> , I talked to a senior Democrat up there today .
Okay , let 's go to <PERSON_1>Sam Donaldson</PERSON_1> at the <ORGANIZATION_2>White House</ORGANIZATION_2> .
<PERSON_1>Sam</PERSON_1> and <PERSON_2>Cokie</PERSON_2> , looking forward to talking to you later .
Have a good evening , and good night from <LOCATION_1>Washington</LOCATION_1> .
From <ORGANIZATION_1>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_1> world headquarters in <LOCATION_2>New York</LOCATION_2> , Wednesday , January twenty-eighth , this is World News Tonight with <PERSON_3>Peter Jennings</PERSON_3> Good evening .
<ORGANIZATION_1>ABC</ORGANIZATION_1> 's <PERSON_2>Sam Donaldson</PERSON_2> is with him .
But for <PERSON_1>Clinton</PERSON_1> today , it was also important .
Vice President <PERSON_1>Gore</PERSON_1> was so uncharacteristically animated in warming up the crowd at the <ORGANIZATION_2>University of Illinois</ORGANIZATION_2> that people leaped to their feet in response .
I give to you the President of the <LOCATION_1>United States of America</LOCATION_1> , <PERSON_2>William Jefferson Clinton</PERSON_2> .
But when he finally did get to <LOCATION_1>La Crosse</LOCATION_1> , <LOCATION_2>Wisconsin</LOCATION_2> , someone had stamped in the snow a negative comment .
<PERSON_1>Clinton</PERSON_1> said to <PERSON_2>Lisa McRee</PERSON_2> on Good Morning America this morning , no more questions , no more answers .
<PERSON_1>Sam Donaldson</PERSON_1> with the President in the Midwest today .
The big question is can the President convince the <ORGANIZATION_1>Congress</ORGANIZATION_1> , <ORGANIZATION_2>Republicans</ORGANIZATION_2> and <ORGANIZATION_3>Democrats</ORGANIZATION_3> , to do what he would like them to do ?
<PERSON_1>Cokie Roberts</PERSON_1> on Capitol Hill tonight .
<PERSON_1>Starr</PERSON_1> is called President <PERSON_2>Clinton</PERSON_2> 's former chief of staff before his grand jury today .
<PERSON_1>Panetta</PERSON_1> , who was chief of staff when <PERSON_2>Lewinsky</PERSON_2> was an intern , spent the entire day inside the grand jury room .
Those words had to be a relief to the <ORGANIZATION_1>White House</ORGANIZATION_1> after <PERSON_2>Panetta</PERSON_2> earlier had made one of the most damaging public comments of any <PERSON_3>Clinton</PERSON_3> ally .
<PERSON_1>Panetta</PERSON_1> apparently was subpoenaed only yesterday in <LOCATION_2>California</LOCATION_2> for today 's appearance .
And now , <ORGANIZATION_1>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_1> has been told by sources that <PERSON_2>Starr</PERSON_2> will soon subpoena several <ORGANIZATION_3>Secret Service</ORGANIZATION_3> employees to see what they might know about a relationship between <PERSON_4>Clinton</PERSON_4> and <PERSON_5>Lewinsky</PERSON_5> .
<PERSON_1>Starr</PERSON_1> 's investigators also were preparing to interview an <LOCATION_2>Oregon</LOCATION_2> man named <PERSON_3>Andy Bleiler</PERSON_3> , who went on television last night with his wife by his side to say that he had an affair with <PERSON_4>Lewinsky</PERSON_4> .
<PERSON_1>Terry Giles</PERSON_1> says she might actually have sought out <PERSON_2>Clinton</PERSON_2> .
If he is right , that would give <PERSON_1>Ken Starr</PERSON_1> more leads to check out .
You know , there 's this question of <ORGANIZATION_1>Secret Service</ORGANIZATION_1> agents being forced to testify against the President .
<ORGANIZATION_1>ABC</ORGANIZATION_1> 's <PERSON_2>Linda Douglass</PERSON_2> reports that <PERSON_3>Charlie Trie</PERSON_3> , the <LOCATION_4>Little Rock</LOCATION_4> businessman and friend of the President , has been charged with several counts , including obstruction of justice .
You heard the President talk forcefully about <LOCATION_1>Iraq</LOCATION_1> last night .
The Secretary of <ORGANIZATION_1>State</ORGANIZATION_1> made it pretty clear today that the <PERSON_2>Clinton</PERSON_2> administration is prepared to go it alone against <LOCATION_3>Iraq</LOCATION_3> if <LOCATION_4>America</LOCATION_4> 's allies are reluctant about punishing <PERSON_5>Saddam Hussein</PERSON_5> militarily .
If , or as many people now believe , when the <LOCATION_1>United States</LOCATION_1> attacks <LOCATION_2>Iraq</LOCATION_2> , it is almost one hundred per cent certain that it will come from the air .
<ORGANIZATION_1>ABC</ORGANIZATION_1> 's <PERSON_2>John McWethy</PERSON_2> reports from the <ORGANIZATION_3>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION_3> .
The <ORGANIZATION_1>Air Force</ORGANIZATION_1> says it now has a variety of new solutions , penetrator warheads with smart fuses that can be set to explode after blasting through a second or third layer of concrete .
Technicians at <LOCATION_1>Eglin Air Force Base</LOCATION_1> say they have solved that problem by creating a warhead that , instead of just exploding , that would vaporize chemical or biological agents .
<PERSON_1>John McWethy</PERSON_1> , <ORGANIZATION_2>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_2> , the <ORGANIZATION_3>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION_3> .
In just a moment , should the <ORGANIZATION_1>Secret Service</ORGANIZATION_1> be forced to testify against the man they are supposed to protect ?
What are the consequences when members of the <ORGANIZATION_1>Secret Service</ORGANIZATION_1> are asked to testify against the persons they are supposed to protect ?
<ORGANIZATION_1>Secret Service</ORGANIZATION_1> agents are with him virtually everywhere he goes , not only at these public rallies , but in the privacy of his car or outside his office .
Agents also testified after the assassination attempt on <PERSON_1>Gerald Ford</PERSON_1> and , six years later , on the shooting of <PERSON_2>Ronald Reagan</PERSON_2> .
It was the most elite assignment in the <ORGANIZATION_1>Secret Service</ORGANIZATION_1> .
But some now worry that confidence could be severely strained if agents are subpoenaed to testify about President <PERSON_1>Clinton</PERSON_1> and his personal life .

From <ORGANIZATION_1>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_1> world headquarters in <LOCATION_2>New York</LOCATION_2> , Thursday , January twenty-ninth , this is World News Tonight with <PERSON_3>Peter Jennings</PERSON_3> .
The independent counsel <PERSON_1>Kenneth Starr</PERSON_1> and the lawyer for <PERSON_2>Monica Lewinsky</PERSON_2> have not been able to resolve whether <PERSON_3>Lewinsky</PERSON_3> will testify about her relationship with the President in exchange for immunity from prosecution .
After a brief meeting with the independent counsel , lawyer <PERSON_1>William Ginsburg</PERSON_1> curtly said that he was preparing <PERSON_2>Monica Lewinsky</PERSON_2> 's defense , a sign that little or no progress had been made in securing <PERSON_3>Lewinsky</PERSON_3> 's testimony .
Filling in those blanks <PERSON_1>Starr</PERSON_1> believes could prove that there was an effort to get her to lie about her relationship with <PERSON_2>Clinton</PERSON_2> in exchange for a job .
December twenty-eighth , eleven days after <PERSON_1>Lewinsky</PERSON_1> receives the subpoena , administration sources say <PERSON_2>Lewinsky</PERSON_2> meets with the President .
According to <ORGANIZATION_1>The New York Times</ORGANIZATION_1> , <PERSON_2>Clinton</PERSON_2> asks her to say her trips to the <ORGANIZATION_3>White House</ORGANIZATION_3> were to visit someone else .
<PERSON_1>Vernon Jordan</PERSON_1> has said he arranged that because he was impressed with <PERSON_2>Lewinsky</PERSON_2> 's drive and ambition .
He asked that the <PERSON_1>Paula Jones</PERSON_1> lawsuit be halted because her lawyers were trying to get at the same witnesses <PERSON_2>Starr</PERSON_2> is pursuing .
<PERSON_1>Peter</PERSON_1> and <PERSON_2>Jackie</PERSON_2> , thanks very much .
<ORGANIZATION_1>ABC</ORGANIZATION_1> 's chief legal analyst , <PERSON_2>Jeffrey Toobin</PERSON_2> , joins us this evening .
At the <ORGANIZATION_1>White House</ORGANIZATION_1> today , the President 's spokesman was not at all forthcoming about <PERSON_2>Monica Lewinsky</PERSON_2> and that <ORGANIZATION_3>White House</ORGANIZATION_3> meeting on December the twenty-eighth .
As <ORGANIZATION_1>ABC</ORGANIZATION_1> 's <PERSON_2>Sam Donaldson</PERSON_2> reports tonight , <PERSON_3>Sam</PERSON_3> , the <ORGANIZATION_4>White House</ORGANIZATION_4> has its strategy .

I 'm <PERSON_1>Peter Jennings</PERSON_1> .
From <ORGANIZATION_1>ABC News</ORGANIZATION_1> world headquarters in <LOCATION_2>New York</LOCATION_2> , Friday , January thirtieth , this is World News Tonight with <PERSON_3>Peter</PERSON_3> , Good evening .
The administration 's efforts to discredit <PERSON_1>Starr</PERSON_1> 's investigation , and <PERSON_2>Starr</PERSON_2> himself , with the ranking Democrat on the <ORGANIZATION_3>House Judiciary Committee</ORGANIZATION_3> is calling for a counter investigation .
The chairman of the committee , Republican <PERSON_1>Henry Hyde</PERSON_1> , quickly knocked down the request , saying that he has the highest regard for <PERSON_2>Starr</PERSON_2> 's competence and integrity .
An angry <PERSON_1>Bob Weiner</PERSON_1> said all he had done was make calls from his home to local Democrats about whether <PERSON_2>Linda Tripp</PERSON_2> 's taping of <PERSON_3>Monica Lewinsky</PERSON_3> 's calls was illegal .
In her first public statement , <PERSON_1>Tripp</PERSON_1> claimed that she was present when <PERSON_2>Lewinsky</PERSON_2> received a late night phone call from the President .
<PERSON_1>Starr</PERSON_1> , meanwhile , is pushing ahead .
She 's the former deputy chief of staff who transferred <PERSON_1>Lewinsky</PERSON_1> from the <ORGANIZATION_2>White House</ORGANIZATION_2> to the <ORGANIZATION_3>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION_3> .
According to law enforcement sources , <PERSON_1>Starr</PERSON_1> so far has come up empty in a search for forensic evidence of a relationship between <PERSON_2>Clinton</PERSON_2> and <PERSON_3>Lewinsky</PERSON_3> .
Tonight , there are indications that while <PERSON_1>Starr</PERSON_1> is still confident about his investigation , he may need to engage in some kind of public relations damage control to counter the <ORGANIZATION_2>White House</ORGANIZATION_2> strategy .
Later tonight on twenty twenty , the biography of <PERSON_1>Monica Lewinsky</PERSON_1> .
Are these consultations with the allies really meaningful , or has the <PERSON_1>Clinton</PERSON_1> administration decided already that <PERSON_2>Saddam Hussein</PERSON_2> will be attacked ?
<ORGANIZATION_1>Cabinet</ORGANIZATION_1> members still have some traveling to do .
After meeting here tonight with <LOCATION_1>Jordan</LOCATION_1> 's King <PERSON_2>Hussein</PERSON_2> , Secretary <PERSON_3>Albright</PERSON_3> will go to the <LOCATION_4>Middle East</LOCATION_4> and the Gulf , asking the Saudis to allow <LOCATION_5>US</LOCATION_5> planes to use their bases for bombing raids .
And officials say it would simply not be feasible to bomb <LOCATION_1>Iraq</LOCATION_1> with <ORGANIZATION_2>Defense</ORGANIZATION_2> Secretary <PERSON_3>William Cohen</PERSON_3> out of the <ORGANIZATION_4>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION_4> .
So the <LOCATION_1>US</LOCATION_1> is virtually advertising its plans to bomb <LOCATION_2>Iraq</LOCATION_2> in two weeks or so , at least another two weeks for <PERSON_3>Saddam Hussein</PERSON_3> to change his mind .

Still , remember the warning <ORGANIZATION_1>The New York Times</ORGANIZATION_1> gives in this reporters handbook .
