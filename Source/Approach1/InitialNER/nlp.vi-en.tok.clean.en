For the moment , the two Coburns are being allowed to coexist , but the Ethics Committee is still deliberating .
If the Ethics Committee says , Coburn , you can either be Congressman Coburn or Coburn , which will you if I lose that battle , I 'm going to be a doctor .
And sometimes , as in the case of Tom Coburn , that would seem to be true , Peter .

The Unabomber trial is on hold until an independent psychiatrist determines whether Kaczynski is mentally fit to stand trial at all .
ABC 's legal affairs correspondent Terry Moran is in Sacramento tonight .

Nice to have you back on the beat again , Sam Donaldson .
Saddam must comply or else , without exactly specifying what that or else might be .
If Saddam Hussein does this , it is a clear and serious violation of the United Nations Security Council resolution .
The director of the UN 's team , Richard Butler , conferred with Secretary General Kofi Annan late today after writing the Security Council that his team had already conducted inspections at seven sites today when Iraq stopped them .
Well , he 's getting away with , you know , willful violations and harassment of UN objectives there , and the UN has responded to that .
The administration insists this is a UN problem , but if Saddam gets away with American inspectors , White House officials here understand it will be seen as a victory over the US and Bill Clinton , not over UN Secretary General Kofi Annan .
Does the White House think the situation is better , worse or about the same ?

A stock broker who had just lost his job took off after photographers Peregrine had been among the fastest growing firms in Asia , but then it made a big mistake , loaning more than six hundred million dollars to companies in Indonesia .
But in Indonesia , analysts say , at least a hundred could collapse , much of Asia is struggling to get out from under a mountain of debt .

But Karla Faye , with a record of drug abuse and prostitution from the age of ten , has remained here at the Gatesville , Texas , women 's prison for fourteen years , awaiting execution .
And although death row conversions are nothing new , Brown and other conservative Christians have embraced Karla Faye and argued strongly for clemency .
Ron Carlson agrees , and he 's the brother of the woman Karla Faye murdered .
The fate of Karla Faye Tucker now rests in the hands of the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles .

Could Saddam Hussein really have tested biological weapons ?
ABC News has learned that the Justice Department is deep into an investigation of the President 's secretary of the labor , Alexis Herman .
ABC 's chief investigative reporter , Brian Ross , is on the story .
As a top assistant to President Clinton , Alexis Herman had power and connections inside the White House .
To Alexis Herman , the United Nations is very suspicious .
The Justice Department investigation of Herman began last October with Laurent Yene , a businessman from Africa whose allegations , officials say , were found credible enough to extend the initial thirty day review to a second stage , ninety day review , a process that could lead to the appointment of an independent counsel .
Yene has told Justice Department lawyers and FBI agents that he and Herman and one of Herman 's close friends began a secret arrangement in nineteen ninety-four to sell Herman 's White House influence to clients needing help from the government , allegedly giving Herman ten percent of any consulting fees .
The documents do not contain Herman 's name , but Yene says they lay out a complex financial scheme to funnel money to Herman for helping one client obtain an FCC license for a satellite telephone system .
Even though she worked at the White House ?
Secretary Herman 's friend and the client seeking the FCC license called Yene a liar seeking revenge because of a falling out over business and personal matters .
Okay , Brian Ross , thanks very much .
ABC 's Sam Donaldson is there .
But the difference is that Herman 's accuser did not at the time claim to be giving cash to her in return for favors for the business , as he has now claimed to Brian Ross .
Clinton was deposed today ?
There was only nine minutes , ten minutes of questions , and Clinton told him under oath , and the person that questioned her , that she had no knowledge whatsoever of how those files were obtained .
It 's not clear yet how far the judge is going to allow her attorneys to delve into Clinton 's past .

Did a Maryland college get sufficient warning before a disastrous trip to Guatemala ?
From ABC News world headquarters in New York , Monday, January 19 , this is World News Tonight with Peter Jennings Good evening .
They have had a terrible weekend trying to figure out why such a sudden outburst of violence engulfed their students on a trip to Central America .
David Ensor reports there are now difficult questions for the college and for Washington .
Recent incidents , says the State Department , which include shootings , kidnappings , rapes and violent assaults , for the most part , have occurred during daylight hours and , in many cases , have affected entire groups of American tourists .
David Ensor , ABC News , the State Department .
The chief UN weapons inspector , who has been talking with senior Iraqi officials , appeared to soften one of his long standing positions , that Iraq have no say in how many Americans work on the inspection teams .
As he arrived in Baghdad , Butler sent a strong signal that he may now be willing to yield to Iraq 's demand for more non American inspectors .
But Butler again demanded full access to Saddam Hussein 's presidential palaces , which Iraq has declared off limits .
And in a demonstration timed to coincide with Butler 's visit , Iraqi women marched alongside a caravan of taxis today bearing the coffins of infants they say died because of the sanctions .

In London today , the men who run the political wing of the Irish Republican Army were at the Prime Minister 's residence for another unsatisfactory negotiating session about how to share power in Northern Ireland .
The accusations are made in a book by the former US ambassador to Britain , Raymond Seitz , and one of those he takes to task is the current US ambassador to Ireland , Jean Kennedy Smith , the late President Kennedy 's sister .
Former Ambassador Seitz claimed the last British government under Prime Minister John Major was convinced that the Clinton administration was leaking British secrets to the IRA .
She was an ardent IRA apologist .
Ambassador Seitz did not directly accused Kennedy Smith of passing on British secrets to the IRA , but a former British minister for Northern Ireland said today that London did withhold intelligence from the US , fearing that leaks from her might endanger the lives of British soldiers .
Ambassador Seitz had often argued against negotiations with the IRA , such as those held today at Number ten Downing Street .

ABC 's Michele Norris begins her report in Riverside , California .
Many of those residents rejected the school board 's proposal to name the new school for Martin Luther King, Junior , the majority of people there are going to be white or with more money , and that 's not what Martin Luther King worked for at all .
Some people think that Martin Luther King, Junior was a hero for African Americans and not for all Americans , and they think that anything that bears his name is somehow stigmatized apparently .
From Chicago to New Jersey to Los Angeles and Miami , the streets that bear his name are boulevards of broken dreams .

Each of them has something to say about the United States as well .
John Paul 's advancing Parkinson 's disease may have slowed his step , but not , apparently , his will to push for political change .
He opposes the US embargo of Cuba , arguing it only hurts ordinary Cubans .
And the Pope from Poland is a champion of small countries remaining completely independent from large powerful neighbors , as Castro 's Cuba has from the US .
But this Pope is also a champion of human rights , and he 's expected to say clearly in Cuba that Castro must begin to give Cubans more freedoms .
Fidel Castro will hear such calls for freedom in person this week from the world 's most famous living force for nonviolent change .
Bill Blakemore , ABC News , Vatican City .
Fidel Castro invited John Paul to come for a reason .
It will give the rest of the world a view that Cuba is like any other nation , something the US has , of course , tried to persuade the world that it is not .
The main positive for Castro to invite the Pope is international , to be able to say to the rest of the world , this government is not as closed , as intolerant , as totalitarian as some make it out to be .

First of all , despite the hardship , Cubans are famous for the White House .
From ABC , this is World News Tonight with Peter Jennings .
The other very big story of the day is in Washington , where the Clinton administration has already been badly shaken up by the possibility that President Clinton and one of his advisors , Vernon Jordan , obstructed justice by encouraging a young woman to commit perjury about an affair she is alleged to have had with the President .
We 'll talk to our legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin .
But first , we go to ABC 's Sam Donaldson , where the bombshell fell at the White House .
Sam and Peter , it 's been a confusing day here at the White House , as President Clinton and his aides have sought to satisfy a stunned public that Clinton is totally innocent of these dangerous charges .
Had there been a sexual relationship , proper or improper , with Monica Lewinsky in the past when she was a White House intern ?
Aides said the President would clear up these ambiguities in a subsequent interview at the White House with National Public Radio interviewers Robert Siegel and Mara Liasson .
ABC News has learned from sources that the woman , after she left the White House employment , was cleared in often , sometimes late at night .
Late today , the independent counsel Kenneth Starr sent over a wide ranging subpoena for all of the records that have to do with Lewinsky 's visits or time at the White House .
We first learned about this story from ABC 's Jackie Judd .
When Monica Lewinsky left the White House to work at the Pentagon , she became friends with this woman , Linda Tripp , and it is Tripp who , months later , brought Lewinsky to the attention of the independent counsel , Ken Starr .
ABC News has learned that last summer Tripp began recording her phone conversations with Lewinsky in which the young woman allegedly spoke about her affair with Clinton and his efforts to convince her to lie to cover it up .
She had earlier worked at the White House , and one source says she was angry when Clinton 's attorney Robert Bennett called her a liar for claiming the President had made a pass at another White House aide .
Why would Tripp go to Starr ?
Because Tripp knew independent counsel Starr and didn 't trust the Justice Department to protect her , Tripp went to Starr with tapes of more than ten calls with Lewinsky .
ABC News also has learned that Starr 's office and the FBI wired Tripp to record a conversation with Lewinsky and gave her equipment to tape more calls so that investigators could hear for themselves what had been in the earlier tapes .
Lewinsky allegedly claims in the tapes that Clinton told her to deny their relationship to Jones ' lawyers and to see Clinton confidante Vernon Jordan .
Sources tell ABC News that Jordan also helped Lewinsky find a lawyer , who filed a sworn affidavit in which she did deny a sexual relationship with the President .
Sources say as of now , Peter , she plans on taking the Fifth .
Jackie Judd in Washington , who , as I said , first brought this story to light .
Jeffrey , on what basis does Kenneth Starr get involved in this in the first place ?
But his jurisdiction , over the four years he 's been in office , has been expanded several times to include the Travel Office allegations , the FBI files issue Vince Foster 's suicide .
It came very quickly , and the judge the judges who supervise independent counsels ratified Judge Reno 's , Attorney General Reno 's request that Starr be given the new authority .
These interviews the President has been giving today to Public Broadcasting and National Public Radio were all sort of pre-fixed because they were in preparation for the President's State of the Union .
One of the people you 've already heard of this evening who questioned the President was National Public Radio 's Mara Liasson .
And he was more unequivocal in his denials with us than he had been with Jim Lehrer of Public Broadcasting .
Let 's go back to Sam Donaldson at the White House .
The danger is that more evidence would pile up that the President had suggested that this young woman lie under oath or that he had Vernon Jordan or someone else do that .
Okay , Sam , thanks very much and everybody else in Washington and New York , good night as one would hope , from the White House 's point of view , I meant one would think from the White House 's point of view that with all these denials , he might be a bit more relaxed .
And he didn 't waste any time today telling the United States and Cuba , both of them , they should change .
But it has taken John Paul The second until the twilight years of his papacy to finally come to Cuba .
But for him to come here , where the Catholic Church has been hampered and restricted for so many years , where this past Christmas celebration was the first one since nineteen fifty-nine , where he will surely be compelled to talk about the American blockade of Cuba , where you can feel Cuba straining to change , now this is a big moment here .
John Paul is too frail now to kneel down and kiss the ground .
John Paul 's response sounded in part like a direct call for democracy in Cuba , telling Cubans to control their own history .
Asked if he had a message for the US about its embargo of Cuba , he said to change .
When reporters asked him what he wants to hear from the Cuban president , John Paul said simply , the truth .
Somebody looking at this saw Fidel Castro in a suit said , in Cuba that 's the first time .
Conchita Diaz did and was welcomed at hers .
Patricia Rotea Galindo came to Havana to look for a life she left behind when she was ten , and she found it in a graveyard .
We 'll be back in Havana later in the broadcast .
And a familiar name is involved , John Gotti .
He was among forty alleged members of the Gambino crime family indicted by the government .
They say that John Gotti followed in his father 's footsteps by becoming a mob boss .
The case began when investigators planted bugs in the home of Gregory DePalma , an aging soldier in the Gambino family .
And there were new scams , a sophisticated phone card fraud involving former pitcher Denny MacLaine and a deal where the mob used minority workers to demand no-show jobs from construction contractors .
John Miller , ABC News , New York .
Chief weapons inspector Richard Butler left Baghdad today after getting nowhere in two days of talks .
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat arrived in Washington today for talks about the Middle East peace process .
And tomorrow , he 'll be at the White House for a meeting with President Clinton .
The Federal Reserve said that while the US economy is still growing at a moderate pace , manufacturers report a decrease in Asian demand for US goods .
And Peter will be back from Havana in a moment .
Fidel never came .
It has always been harder for outsiders to get a precise fix on what Fidel Castro is going to do or really thinks about his relationship with the United States .
Ricardo Alarcon is the president of the Cuban National Assembly .
I have heard Cuban analysts say before that the best thing President Clinton could do for Cubans is to lift the embargo because , ultimately , it would undermine the governmental authority of President Castro .
Good night from Central Park , Havana 's Central Park .
From ABC News world headquarters in New York , Thursday, January twenty-second , this is World News Tonight with Peter Jennings .
The presidential entourage has dutifully tried to circle the wagons , but morale at the White House is not good .
So let 's go to our White House correspondent first , Sam Donaldson .
The President spoke during a photo opportunity with visiting Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat .
Later , Vernon Jordan , the President 's close friend , surfaced before the microphones to deny he has done anything wrong in his dealings with Monica Lewinsky .
Jordan said presidential secretary Betty Currie referred Lewinsky to him , and he tried to help her find employment at Revlon and at American Express .
His worst moment coming on the subject of Gennifer Flowers , who Clinton talked about back in nineteen ninety-two on Sixty Minutes .
The independent counsel has sent over other subpoenas , one for Betty Currie , the presidential secretary .
Sam Donaldson at the White House tonight .
So much depends on what Monica Lewinsky does or says , more specifically , next .
Monica Lewinsky 's lawyer , William Ginsburg , arrived in Washington late today to prepare his client for whatever comes next .
We have a hearing tonight with the judge in Arkansas , Judge Wright , and she will determine then whether the hearing is going to go forward .
Ginsburg wants it delayed because Lewinsky is now so embroiled in Ken Starr 's criminal investigation , and he wants some time , possibly to strike a deal with Starr .
ABC News learned today , that after Lewinsky was confronted at this hotel by investigators and told there were tapes of her allegations against the President , she was offered leniency if she agreed to wear a wire and secretly tape conversations of others , presumably , Vernon Jordan , Clinton 's secretary and possibly the President himself .
There were more developments today regarding this document , obtained by ABC News .
Tripp also had been subpoenaed by lawyers for Paula Jones , and this document contains talking points , instructions for how to answer their questions .
About Lewinsky , it is suggested that Tripp say she found out Lewinsky left the White House because she was stalking President , not because she was having an affair with him .
Thanks very much , Jackie Judd in Washington .
In President Kennedy 's day , Bill Clinton 's idol , the President 's personal relationships inside the White House were ignored by the press .
So where does Monica Lewinsky fit in ?
She was like many kids at Beverly Hills High School , the product of a bitter divorce .
She later went to Portland , Oregon , where she graduated as a psychology major from Lewis and Clark College .
Linda Douglass , ABC News , Washington .
The Unabomber 's confession , Ted Kaczynski admits everything .
In California , the trial of the Unabomber has come to an abrupt end , just as opening statements were about to start .
In Sacramento , first of all , here 's ABC 's Ken Kashiwahara .
And the Justice Department had insisted on pursuing the death penalty , believing Kaczynski to be sane .
All , Kaczynski 's attorneys had all but conceded his guilt and planned to convince the jury he should be spared the death penalty .
Ken Kashiwahara , ABC News , Sacramento .
It is for Ted Kaczynski in this trial .
Terry Moran in Sacramento , along with Ken Kashiwahara .
ABC 's national security correspondent John McWethy has more .
Sources tell ABC News that the Americans who conducted this operation are part of a highly secret commando unit that the Pentagon has denied even exists .
John McWethy , ABC News , the Pentagon .
On Wall Street today , the Dow Jones Industrials lost more than sixty-three points to close at seventy-seven thirty .
Tonight , c closer look at the other man in this White House crisis , Vernon Jordan .
ABC 's Chris Wallace has covered him for years .
Clinton has turned to the sixty-two year old Jordan often to help steer him out of trouble .
On the night White House official Vincent Foster shot himself , Jordan was at the President 's side .
But sometimes the President's problems have become problems for Jordan .
When Webster Hubbell left the Justice Department , Jordan reportedly helped line up jobs for him .
According to sources who have heard the secret tapes , Monica Lewinsky says Jordan told her to lie about her relationship with the President , and Jordan admitted today he tried to help her get a job , although he made it sound like just a good deed .
But in nineteen eighty-one , Jordan changed careers .
Now he wears shirts handmade in London and drives a red Cadillac , and one black activist has written of what he calls Vernon Jordan disease , powerful blacks who forget their roots and leave their people behind .
A longtime Washington insider put it this way , Vernon Jordan might go right up to the line , but he won 't go to jail for the President or anyone else .
Our legal analyst Jeff Toobin is here .
And that means , in this case , that Ken Starr would have to prove that Vernon Jordan intended that Monica Lewinsky lie in her deposition .
Well , the next important step , it seems to me , is Monica Lewinsky 's deposition in the Paula Jones case .
Finally this evening , Pope John Paul .
ABC 's Bill Blakemore is still there .
And John Paul criticized the government , said its economic system creates poverty whose pressures tear families apart , even make them leave the country .
The Pope 's critique was actually heard by millions in Cuba because Fidel Castro made a last minute decision to televise this Mass nationwide , a risk he 's willing to take for the benefits of hosting John Paul .

Fairly obvious , President Clinton denied again today that he had an affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky , and the President 's close friend Vernon Jordan said he never asked Lewinsky to lie .
I 'm Peter Jennings .
From ABC News world headquarters in New York , Friday January twenty-third , this is World News Tonight with Peter Jennings .
Today , someone with specific knowledge of what it is that Monica Lewinsky says really took place between her and the President has been talking to ABC 's Jackie Judd .
The source says Monica Lewinsky claims she would visit the White House for sex with Clinton in the early evening or early mornings on the weekends , when certain aides who would find her presence disturbing were not at the office .
And what was Lewinsky told to say about the affair after receiving a subpoena from lawyers for Paula Jones ?
ABC News has obtained documents which confirm that Lewinsky made efforts to stay in contact with the President after she left the White House .
The packages were sent to the southwest gate with a contact number for Betty Currie , the President 's personal secretary .
Another package sent to Vernon Jordan 's law firm , we are told , contained a list of jobs that Lewinsky would be interested in .
Her attorney , William Ginsburg , today accused investigators from independent counsel Ken Starr 's office of putting the squeeze on Lewinsky to win her cooperation .
After he had the the wire material , he lured Miss Lewinsky to the Ritz Carlton hotel in Pentagon City and , with the help of four or five FBI agents and three or four US attorneys , managed to detain her , although she was technically free to go , for eight or nine hours without an attorney .
We 've learned , Peter , that tomorrow , Starr and Ginsburg will meet about cutting a deal and getting Monica Lewinsky to cooperate in this criminal investigation .
While the lawyers and certainly reporters have been focused on the allegations of illicit sex and allegations that Monica Lewinsky was encouraged to lie on the President 's behalf , and these are still allegations we are dealing with , the President 's staff has been trying to wrench the country 's attention back to his political agenda .
Sam and Peter , it hasn 't been easy for him , right ?
And it was left to presidential spokesman Mike McCurry to bring things back to reality .
Sam Donaldson at the White House tonight .
What about Clinton ?
Linda tell ABC News that Clinton is handling these latest allegations with steely resolve .
But for Clinton , it may have been like a scene from a recurring nightmare in which she is forced to fight charges that her husband is a womanizer as she has done before .
ABC News has learned that Clinton is consulting and calling a close circle of friends and advisors trying to develop a strategy .
Linda Douglass in Washington tonight .
They say that Clinton is being victimized by the independent counsel , Kenneth Starr , who is a Republican out to get him , they say .
How does he get from investigating a Whitewater land deal to allegations of sex and cover up ?
But with court approval , it has been expanded repeatedly , to Web Hubbell , then number two at the Justice Department , who Starr convicted of bilking clients while a lawyer years earlier in Arkansas , to improprieties at the White House Travel Office , misuse of FBI files , Vince Foster 's suicide , and now to suggestions of obstruction of justice in the Lewinsky case .
Lawrence Walsh was the independent counsel in Iran .
He says Starr 's investigation may be legal , but that it 's inappropriate for him to interfere in Paula Jones ' pending civil suit in which Monica Lewinsky is a witness .
President Bush made him solicitor general , his administration 's top courtroom advocate .
If people don 't understand how the Whitewater investigation in Little Rock has stretched to a sex and perjury scandal in Washington , Starr himself has done little to help .
Tim O'Brien , ABC News , Washington .
But le t's put it to our legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin .
He is investigating this case at the request of Janet Reno and with court approval .
Legal analyst Jeff Toobin .
This certainly concerns the White House .

I think Clinton , he will be redeemed .

Okay , Tom Rosenstiel , thanks very much .
Today , the chief UN inspector Richard Butler told the UN Security Council that Iraq is no longer willing to cooperate with his weapons inspectors .
The Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said that the United States would start consulting its allies about using military force , even though most of them are reluctant .

ABC 's Barry Serafin focuses on a US consulate in Brazil .
It was in Sao Paulo , Brazil , that the State Department guidelines were first brought to light .
The State Department denies rejecting visas on the basis of race but acknowledges it does use guidelines like those in Sao Paulo and says it will continue to use them .

The Pope was cheered by a large crowd in Camaguey when he called for more freedom in Cuba .
A source has told ABC 's Jackie Judd more details about the alleged affair between Monica Lewinsky and the President .
Later this evening , Twenty Twenty and Nightline will have the latest on the crisis in the White House .
So I 'm Peter Jennings .
The former White House intern who could challenge President Clinton 's sworn testimony once again talking a deal with the special prosecutor , and close friends and advisors rush to offer their advice to the President as the White House sinks deeper into crisis .
Here 's Forrest Sawyer .
A new ABC News poll today shows less than half of Americans believe Clinton has quote the honesty and integrity to serve effectively .
We have several reports , beginning with ABC 's Jackie Judd in Washington .
The struggle between independent counsel Ken Starr and lawyer William Ginsburg about Monica Lewinsky 's future reached no resolution today .
Because Starr could potentially bring such charges as perjury and obstruction of justice against Lewinsky , some analysts say that he has the upper hand .
But he also knows that Monica Lewinsky desperately needs the protection of the independent counsel .
And Starr seems hell bent on getting President Clinton .
A source tells ABC News that Lewinsky consented to having FBI agents go through her apartment at the Watergate on Thursday for evidence related to the alleged affair with Clinton .
Today , a New York literary agent admitted that she told Tripp to tape the calls as a way of protecting herself if all of this became public .
Forrest and Jackie Judd in Washington .
ABC 's Sam Donaldson joins us with the latest from the White House .
The President 's Hollywood friend Harry Thomasson , who 's given advice in the past on public relations , spent the night .
Even Harold Ickes , who left after the first term , disappointed he 'd not been made chief of staff , is said to be lending a hand on an unpaid basis .
In fact , Leon Panetta , his former chief of staff , today called the scandal a crisis for the party and said if the charges are not baseless , it would be better if Vice President Gore became president now .
Party chairman Roy Romer , in an interview with ABC News , appeared horrified at even being asked to comment on Panetta 's advice .
Along with other national security officials , Gore attended a full scale meeting on another crisis in Iraq .
Forrest and Sam Donaldson at the White House .
Joining us , former Clinton advisor and ABC News political analyst , George Stephanopoulos .

Here 's ABC 's Mike Lee .
It rocked most of the world , from Jerusalem , to Moscow , to Berlin .
In France , where the media virtually ignored the late President Mitterrand 's illegitimate child , many shrug off allegations against President Clinton .
Mike Lee , ABC News , London .
Still ahead on World News Tonight this Saturday , how Vice President Gore is handling the crisis in the White House .
Al Gore and Bill Clinton are good friends , but in this crisis they may very well find themselves on different sides of the fence .
There was no press access to the Vice President when he arrived at the White House late this afternoon .
It does not do the Democratic party any good , it certainly doesn 't do the Vice President any good .
His schedule is unchanged , including a dinner here tonight at his residence with House monority leader and one time Clinton opponent , Richard Gephardt .
Karla Davis , ABC News , Washington .
I mean , that 's why they call him Slick Willy .
It is part of a pattern of nuanced responses to everyday moral dilemmas that has characterized Clinton 's career .

Here 's ABC 's Bill Blakemore .
Fidel Castro is allowing this and all of John Paul 's masses here in Cuba to be televised nationwide .
The dictator has appeared deeply respectful of Pope John Paul on TV here .

ABC 's John Martin reports on the media in full battle mode .
The President 's press secretary , Mike McCurry , issued in the new media world of cable and internet , it 's all Lewinsky , all the time .
Not the Monica Lewinsky that I knew ?
They don 't pay at US News and World Report but it 's looking for facts in a hurry , too .
John Martin , ABC News , Washington .
Trying to understand this White House crisis , there are people who believe the presidency is really in jeopardy .
Tomorrow , Good Morning America Sunday and This Week with Sam and Cokie .
Monica Lewinsky seen but not heard .
Reporting tonight from Washington .
Miss Lewinsky and her lawyer are negotiating today with the independent counsel about the basis on which she might testify to this alleged affair .
So we 're going to begin tonight 's reporting with Sam Donaldson , who 's at the White House .
At a White House ceremony on child care programs presided over by his wife which he had not planned to attend , Clinton stepped forward to make an emotional and somewhat angry statement .
It was left to press secretary Mike McCurry to dodge a barrage of questions .
When Gennifer Flowers made that claim back in nineteen ninety two , she produced audio tapes on which Clinton is heard apparently telling her to lie about it .
Sam , I have one more question about the White House , but just hang on for one sec , if you would .
So here is ABC 's Jackie Judd .
Time is running out for negotiations because Lewinsky has been subpoenaed to appear before Starr 's grand jury as early as tomorrow .
Sources have told ABC News that Starr received information that an eyewitness discovered the pair in an intimate moment at the White House in the spring of nineteen ninety six .
The White House spokesman , Mike McCurry , claimed today that he has been unable to find any staff member aware of such an incident .
But a source with direct knowledge of what Lewinsky has claimed has provided ABC News with two dates when Clinton allegedly called her and talked about sex .
It was subpoenas from lawyers for Paula Jones that led to all these revelations about Lewinsky .
Today , Clinton 's lawyer Robert Bennett argued that Clinton enemies are using the Jones ' case to destroy the President .
As for what you are thinking many things , it seems , but the White House is pleased that the President 's job approval rating is still high .
Which takes us back now to Sam Donaldson at the White House .
That he is going to say no sexual relations period , go up tomorrow night in his State of the Union address , not mention this , according to White House aides .
There 's a photo released by the White House .
Well , not for the first time , amid all the White House turmoil , Iraq was quickly moving up the list on the President 's agenda today .
And so , ABC 's John McWethy tells us tonight that the clock may really be ticking .
It provides a window of maximum US strength , plus a back up in case Saudi Arabia and Bahrain refuse to allow the US to launch air strikes from their territory .
Among the last bits of string , Moscow has rushed a special envoy to Baghdad , while President Yeltsin has said Russia strongly opposes military action .
And for those who might think President Clinton 's sex scandal is paralyzing the government , there was a warning from an unusual quarter today to Saddam Hussein .
John McWethy , ABC News , the Pentagon .
In Moscow today , the Russian government said it is now certain that Russia 's last czar , Nicholas The second , and his family were all executed and their bodies dumped into a pit at the time of the Russian revolution .

When we come back , pressure on the White House .
Probably much of the country would like to take a closer look inside the White House tonight to see how the President and his inner circle are really dealing with these challenges to his credibility .
On trade agreement , USTR thinks it 's two forty right now .
Yeah , Gene Sperling says what so many insiders say , Bill Clinton has an uncanny ability to focus , no matter what is going on around him .
Cokie , one assumes that the Congress is going to come back and be polite tomorrow night .
In the week ahead , if things stay pretty much as they are now , how much trouble will the President be in with the Congress ?
President Clinton said more forcefully today that he did not have a sexual relationship with the White House intern Monica Lewinsky .
As we heard earlier , the White House is even nervous that its Iraq policy might be perceived to be influenced by the President 's personal problems .
In Wag The Dog , the nation 's President has sex with a young visitor to the White House .
Some White House officials are said to be equally concerned about the portrayal of the President in another movie to be released in March .
A hairdresser has come forward alleging a long-term Hollywood insiders say movie makers aren 't trying to satirize or hurt President Clinton .
Beth Nissen , ABC News , New York .
The independent counsel , Kenneth Starr , says nonsense .
It 's always a big event , this traditional visit to the Congress by the President to report on the state of the nation .
So let 's first go to the White House and ABC 's Sam Donaldson .
The trouble began this morning when the First Lady showed up for an interview in New York City on the NBC News Today Show , during which she vigorously defended her husband .
Starr quickly fired back .
Peter and Sam , thanks .
In the latest ABC News poll , we find that more people disapprove of the way Starr is conducting himself .
Along with independent counsel Kenneth Starr , conservative senators Jesse Helms and Lauch Faircloth for their alleged role in supporting Starr , and conservative activist Jerry Falwell , whom she accused of peddling a video filled with wild accusations about the Clintons .
For all the drama of her remarks , Clinton was alone in their old territory .
While it was widely ridiculed as paranoid when it was leaked , White House spokesman Mike McCurry defended it .
For example , the conservative Rutherford Institute is funding the Paula Jones case against the President .
Michel McQueen , ABC News , Washington .
As for the independent counsel , here in Washington today , the first of numerous witnesses that Kenneth Starr has subpoenaed in this phase of his investigation appeared before a grand jury .
Here 's ABC 's Jackie Judd .
She 's relevant to the investigation because it was Currie whose name and phone number appeared on packages that Monica Lewinsky sent to the White House and who , according to sources , cleared Lewinsky into the White House to visit Clinton .
And it was Betty Currie , according to Vernon Jordan , who asked him to help Lewinsky find a job .
Today , ABC News learned more about what Lewinsky said when she was secretly taped by investigators .
And she allegedly urged Tripp to meet with Clinton 's attorney , Robert Bennett .
Thank you , Peter and Jackie Judd .
In the early edition of the Dallas Morning News , it was reported that a Secret Service agent was prepared to testify that he had seen the President and Monica Lewinsky in an intimate situation .

Have a good evening , and good night from Washington .
From ABC News world headquarters in New York , Wednesday, January twenty-eighth , this is World News Tonight with Peter Jennings Good evening .
ABC 's Sam Donaldson is with him .
But for Clinton today , it was also important .
Vice President Gore was so uncharacteristically animated in warming up the crowd at the University of Illinois that people leaped to their feet in response .
I give to you the President of the United States of America , William Jefferson Clinton .
But when he finally did get to La Crosse , Wisconsin , someone had stamped in the snow a negative comment .

The big question is can the President convince the Congress , Republicans and Democrats , to do what he would like them to do ?

Starr is called President Clinton 's former chief of staff before his grand jury today .
Panetta , who was chief of staff when Lewinsky was an intern , spent the entire day inside the grand jury room .
Those words had to be a relief to the White House after Panetta earlier had made one of the most damaging public comments of any Clinton ally .
Panetta apparently was subpoenaed only yesterday in California for today 's appearance .
And now , ABC News has been told by sources that Starr will soon subpoena several Secret Service employees to see what they might know about a relationship between Clinton and Lewinsky .
Starr 's investigators also were preparing to interview an Oregon man named Andy Bleiler , who went on television last night with his wife by his side to say that he had an affair with Lewinsky .
Terry Giles says she might actually have sought out Clinton .
If he is right , that would give Ken Starr more leads to check out .
You know , there 's this question of Secret Service agents being forced to testify against the President .
ABC 's Linda Douglass reports that Charlie Trie , the Little Rock businessman and friend of the President , has been charged with several counts , including obstruction of justice .
You heard the President talk forcefully about Iraq last night .
The Secretary of State made it pretty clear today that the Clinton administration is prepared to go it alone against Iraq if America 's allies are reluctant about punishing Saddam Hussein militarily .
If , or as many people now believe , when the United States attacks Iraq , it is almost one hundred per cent certain that it will come from the air .
ABC 's John McWethy reports from the Pentagon .
The Air Force says it now has a variety of new solutions , penetrator warheads with smart fuses that can be set to explode after blasting through a second or third layer of concrete .
Technicians at Eglin Air Force Base say they have solved that problem by creating a warhead that , instead of just exploding , that would vaporize chemical or biological agents .
John McWethy , ABC News , the Pentagon .
In just a moment , should the Secret Service be forced to testify against the man they are supposed to protect ?
What are the consequences when members of the Secret Service are asked to testify against the persons they are supposed to protect ?
Secret Service agents are with him virtually everywhere he goes , not only at these public rallies , but in the privacy of his car or outside his office .
Agents also testified after the assassination attempt on Gerald Ford and , six years later , on the shooting of Ronald Reagan .
It was the most elite assignment in the Secret Service .
But some now worry that confidence could be severely strained if agents are subpoenaed to testify about President Clinton and his personal life .

From ABC News world headquarters in New York , Thursday, January twenty-ninth , this is World News Tonight with Peter Jennings .
The independent counsel Kenneth Starr and the lawyer for Monica Lewinsky have not been able to resolve whether Lewinsky will testify about her relationship with the President in exchange for immunity from prosecution .
After a brief meeting with the independent counsel , lawyer William Ginsburg curtly said that he was preparing Monica Lewinsky 's defense , a sign that little or no progress had been made in securing Lewinsky 's testimony .
Filling in those blanks Starr believes could prove that there was an effort to get her to lie about her relationship with Clinton in exchange for a job .
December twenty-eighth , eleven days after Lewinsky receives the subpoena , administration sources say Lewinsky meets with the President .
According to The New York Times , Clinton asks her to say her trips to the White House were to visit someone else .
Vernon Jordan has said he arranged that because he was impressed with Lewinsky 's drive and ambition .
He asked that the Paula Jones lawsuit be halted because her lawyers were trying to get at the same witnesses Starr is pursuing .
Peter and Jackie , thanks very much .
ABC 's chief legal analyst , Jeffrey Toobin , joins us this evening .
At the White House today , the President 's spokesman was not at all forthcoming about Monica Lewinsky and that White House meeting on December the twenty-eighth .
As ABC 's Sam Donaldson reports tonight , Sam , the White House has its strategy .
Naturally , the President 's press secretary Mike McCurry was asked if Monica Lewinsky visited Clinton on December twenty-eighth .
Sources have told ABC News , she often cleared Lewinsky .
For instance , has the President discussed the investigation with Lewinsky in any way at any time ?

From ABC News world headquarters in New York , Friday, January thirtieth , this is World News Tonight with Peter , Good evening .
The administration 's efforts to discredit Starr 's investigation , and Starr himself , with the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee is calling for a counter investigation .
The chairman of the committee , Republican Henry Hyde , quickly knocked down the request , saying that he has the highest regard for Starr 's competence and integrity .
An angry Bob Weiner said all he had done was make calls from his home to local Democrats about whether Linda Tripp 's taping of Monica Lewinsky 's calls was illegal .
In her first public statement , Tripp claimed that she was present when Lewinsky received a late night phone call from the President .
Starr , meanwhile , is pushing ahead .
She 's the former deputy chief of staff who transferred Lewinsky from the White House to the Pentagon .
According to law enforcement sources , Starr so far has come up empty in a search for forensic evidence of a relationship between Clinton and Lewinsky .
Tonight , there are indications that while Starr is still confident about his investigation , he may need to engage in some kind of public relations damage control to counter the White House strategy .
Later tonight on twenty twenty , the biography of Monica Lewinsky .
Are these consultations with the allies really meaningful , or has the Clinton administration decided already that Saddam Hussein will be attacked ?
Cabinet members still have some traveling to do .
After meeting here tonight with Jordan 's King Hussein , Secretary Albright will go to the Middle East and the Gulf , asking the Saudis to allow US planes to use their bases for bombing raids .
And officials say it would simply not be feasible to bomb Iraq with Defense Secretary William Cohen out of the Pentagon .
So the US is virtually advertising its plans to bomb Iraq in two weeks or so , at least another two weeks for Saddam Hussein to change his mind .

The National Weather Service told us this afternoon it is El Nino causing these huge waves on the California coast , and despite the sand berms , some ocean front homes suffered minor flooding .
In nearly three days , they have only made it as far as the Mediterranean .
You remember Cuba .
Tonight , one of the reasons that going to Cuba was a special experience this time , because it was a chance to spend a little time with ABC 's Antonio Mora in the very place where he was born .
Maria Louisa de la Toriente Sendawal my grandfather 's name , and , oh , boy .
Antonio 's great grandfather , Cosme de la Toriente , was a much loved politician and diplomat in Cuba .
Antonio 's father went to the same schools as Castro throughout the nineteen forties , and initially , Antonio 's father supported Castro .
They never returned to Cuba , leaving behind a very comfortable life of large houses , servants and a country farm .
And the stately home of John is now an apartment building .
And Antonio also understands that this is now someone else 's place .

With more American firepower being considered for the Persian Gulf , Defense Secretary Cohen today issued toughest criticism of the UN Security Council .
Frankly , I find it incredibly hard to accept the proposition that , in the face of Saddam 's actions , that members of the Security Council cannot bring themselves to declare that this is a fundamental or material breach of conduct on his part .
In Europe today , Secretary of State for Foreign Affrais Albright , trying to gather support for tougher measures , was told by the British and French that before they will join the US in using force , they insist the Security Council pass yet another resolution .
British Prime Minister Blair said if Saddam Hussein then does not comply The only option to enforce the Security Council 's will is military action .
But even a massive air campaign has sharp limits against a leader like Saddam Hussein .

ABC 's Sheila MacVicar is also in the Iraqi capital .
We know very little about what is on the table with the Russians except for what Posuvalyuk himself has said .
You talk about concessions , Sheila , is there any chance , or what are the chances , in fact that that this will be settled in the coming days ?
We do know there are some reports in Baghdad tonight , and I must emphasize these are unconfirmed reports , that say that in an emergency session of Iraq 's national assembly on Monday morning there will be some kind of proposal voted where the national assembly members ask Iraq 's President , Saddam Hussein , to open the palace to the inspectors .
In the Middle East , the Palestinians today moved to fulfill a promise to President Clinton .
The news came as Secretary of State for Foreign Affrais Madeleine Albright met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu .
There is still no deal with independent counsel Kenneth Starr that would allow Monica Lewinsky to testify .
For the President , it was time for a much needed break , a trip to Camp David with family , friends and golf .
The latest ABC News poll shows that Clinton is not only containing the damage from the Lewinsky scandal , he is actually gaining some ground .
Lucianne Goldberg , who encouraged Linda Tripp to tape her phone calls with Monica Lewinsky , made vague threats toward Lewinsky 's lawyers for criticizing Tripp .
And Lewinsky 's lawyers suggested she might go home to Los Angeles .
